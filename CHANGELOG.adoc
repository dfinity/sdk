== DFX

=== fix: HSMs are once again supported on Linux

On Linux, dfx 0.10.0 failed any operation with an HSM with the following error:
    Error: IO: Dynamic loading not supported

The fix was to once again dynamically-link the Linux build.

=== chore: add context to errors

Most errors that happen within dfx are now reported in much more detail. No more plain `File not found` without explanation what even was attempted.

=== feat: bitcoin integration: dfx now generates the bitcoin adapter config file

dfx command-line parameters for bitcoin integration:
    dfx start   --enable-bitcoin  # use default node 127.0.0.1:18444
    dfx start   --enable-bitcoin --bitcoin-node <node>

The above examples also work for dfx replica.

These default to values from dfx.json:
    .defaults.bitcoin.nodes
    .defaults.bitcoin.enabled

The --bitcoin-node parameter, if specified on the command line, implies --enable-bitcoin.

If --enable-bitcoin or .defaults.bitcoin.enabled is set, then dfx start/replica will launch the ic-btc-adapter process and configure the replica to communicate with it.


=== feat: print wallet balance in a human readable form #2184

Default behaviour changed for `+dfx wallet balance+`, it will now print cycles amount upscaled to trillions.

New flag `+--precise+` added to `+dfx wallet balance+`. Allows to get exact amount of cycles in wallet (without upscaling).

=== feat: canister http integration

dfx command-line parameters for canister http requests integration:
    dfx start --enable-canister-http
    dfx replica --enable-canister-http

This defaults to the following value in dfx.json:
    .defaults.canister_http.enabled

=== Binary cache

Added ic-canister-http-adapter to the binary cache.

== Dependencies

=== Updated agent-rs to 0.16.0

== Motoko

Updated Motoko from 0.6.26 to 0.6.27.

== Replica

Updated replica to elected commit 2e16bb834b05d7eadbe1603c8046a96fe57a1868.

= 0.10.0

== DFX

=== feat: Use null as default value for opt arguments


Before this, `deploy`ing a canister with an `opt Foo` init argument without specifying an `--argument` would lead to an error:

[source, bash]
----
$ dfx deploy
Error: Invalid data: Expected arguments but found none.
----

With this change, this isn't an error anymore, but instead `null` is passed as a value. In general, if the user does _not_ provide an `--argument`, and if the init method expects only `opt` arguments, then `dfx` will supply `null` for each argument.

Note in particular that this does not try to match `opt` arguments for heterogeneous (`opt`/non-`opt`) signatures. Note moreover that this only impacts a case that would previously error out, so no existing (working) workflows should be affected.

=== feat: dfx identity set-wallet now checks that the provided canister is actually a wallet

This check was previously performed on local networks, but not on mainnet.

=== feat: dfx canister call --candid <path to candid file> ...

Allows one to provide the .did file for calls to an arbitrary canister.

=== feat: Install arbitrary wasm into canisters

You no longer need a DFX project setup with a build task to install an already-built wasm module into a canister ID. The new `+--wasm <path>+` flag to `+dfx canister install+` will bypass project configuration and install the wasm module at `+<path>+`. A DFX project setup is still recommended for general use; this should mostly be used for installing pre-built canisters. Note that DFX will also not perform its usual checks for API/ABI/stable-memory compatibility in this mode.

=== feat: Support for 128-bit cycle counts

Cycle counts can now exceed the previously set maximum of 2^64. The new limit is 2^128. A new wallet version has been bundled with this release that supports the new cycle count. You will not be able to use this feature with your existing wallets without running `+dfx wallet upgrade+`, but old wallets will still work just fine with old cycle counts.

=== fix: dfx start will once again notice if dfx is already running

dfx will once again display 'dfx is already running' if dfx is already running,
rather than 'Address already in use'.

As a consequence, after `dfx start` failed to notice that dfx was already running,
it would replace .dfx/pid with an empty file.  Later invocations of `dfx stop`
would display no output and return a successful exit code, but leave dfx running.

=== fix: dfx canister update-settings <canister id> works even if the canister id is not known to the project.

This makes the behavior match the usage text of the command:
`<CANISTER> Specifies the canister name or id to update. You must specify either canister name/id or the --all option`

=== feat: dfx deploy --upgrade-unchanged or dfx canister install --mode upgrade --upgrade-unchanged

When upgrading a canister, `dfx deploy` and `dfx canister install` skip installing the .wasm
if the wasm hash did not change.  This avoids a round trip through stable memory for all
assets on every dfx deploy, for example.  By passing this argument, dfx will instead
install the wasm even if its hash matches the already-installed wasm.

=== feat: Introduce DFX_CACHE_ROOT environment variable

A new environment variable, `DFX_CACHE_ROOT`, has been introduced to allow setting the cache root directory to a different location than the configuration root directory. Previously `DFX_CONFIG_ROOT` was repurposed for this which only allowed one location to be set for both the cache and configuration root directories.

This is a breaking change since setting `DFX_CONFIG_ROOT` will no longer set the cache root directory to that location.

=== fix: Error if nonzero cycles are passed without a wallet proxy

Previously, `dfx canister call --with-cycles 1` would silently ignore the `--with-cycles` argument as the DFX principal has no way to pass cycles and the call must be forwarded through the wallet. Now it will error instead of silently ignoring it. To forward a call through the wallet, use `--wallet $(dfx identity get-wallet)`, or `--wallet $(dfx identity --network ic get-wallet)` for mainnet.

=== feat: Configure subnet type of local replica

The local replica sets its parameters according to the subnet type defined in defaults.replica.subnet_type, defaulting to 'application' when none is specified.
This makes it less likely to accidentally hit the 'cycles limit exceeded' error in production.  Since the previous default was `system`, you may see these types errors in development instead.
Possible values for defaults.replica.subnet_type are: "application", "verifiedapplication", "system"

Example how to specify the subnet type:
[source, json]
----
{
  "defaults": {
    "replica": {
      "subnet_type": "verifiedapplication"
    }
  }
}
----

=== feat: Introduce command for local cycles top-up

`dfx ledger fabricate-cycles <canister (id)> <optional amount>` can be used during local development to create cycles out of thin air and add them to a canister. Instead of supplying a canister name or id it is also possible to use `--all` to add the cycles to every canister in the current project. When no amount is supplied, the command uses 10T cycles as default. Using this command with `--network ic` will result in an error.

=== feat: Private keys can be stored in encrypted format

`dfx identity new` and `dfx identity import` now ask you for a password to encrypt the private key (PEM file) when it is stored on disk.
If you decide to use a password, your key will never be written to disk in plain text.
In case you don't want to enter your password all the time and want to take the risk of storing your private key in plain text, you can use the `--disable-encryption` flag.

The `default` identity as well as already existing identities will NOT be encrypted. If you want to encrypt an existing identity, use the following commands:
[source, bash]
----
dfx identity export identity_name > identity.pem
# if you have set old_identity_name as the identity that is used by default, switch to a different one
dfx identity use other_identity
dfx identity remove identity_name
dfx identity import identity_name identity.pem
----

=== feat: Identity export

If you want to get your identity out of dfx, you can use `dfx identity export identityname > exported_identity.pem`. But be careful with storing this file as it is not protected with your password.

=== feat: Identity new/import now has a --force flag

If you want to script identity creation and don't care about overwriting existing identities, you now can use the `--force` flag for the commands `dfx identity new` and `dfx identity import`.

=== fix: Do not automatically create a wallet on IC

When running `dfx deploy --network ic`, `dfx canister --network ic create`, or `dfx identity --network ic get-wallet` dfx no longer automatically creates a cycles wallet for the user if none is configured. Instead, it will simply report that no wallet was found for that user.

Dfx still creates the wallet automatically when running on a local network, so the typical workflow of `dfx start --clean` and `dfx deploy` will still work without having to manually create the wallet.

=== fix: Identities cannot exist and not at the same time

When something went wrong during identity creation, the identity was not listed as existing.
But when trying to create an identity with that name, it was considered to be already existing.

=== feat: dfx start and dfx replica can now launch the ic-btc-adapter process

Added command-line parameters:
    dfx start   --enable-bitcoin --btc-adapter-config <path>
    dfx replica --enable-bitcoin --btc-adapter-config <path>

These default to values from dfx.json:
    .defaults.bitcoin.btc_adapter_config
    .defaults.bitcoin.enabled

The --btc-adapter-config parameter, if specified on the command line, implies --enable-bitcoin.

If --enable-bitcoin or .defaults.bitcoin.enabled is set, and a btc adapter configuration is specified,
then dfx start/replica will launch the ic-btc-adapter process.

This integration is not yet complete, pending upcoming functionality in ic-starter.

=== fix: report context of errors

dfx now displays the context of an error in several places where previously the only error
message would be something like "No such file or directory."

=== chore: updates starter project for Node 18

Webpack dev server now works for Node 18 (and should work for Node 17). A few packages are also upgraded

== updating dependencies

Updated to version 0.14.0 of agent-rs

== Cycles wallet

    }
  }
}
----

* https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/45982[45982]

== Motoko

Updated Motoko from 0.6.21 to 0.6.25.

= 0.9.2

== DFX

=== feat: Verify Candid and Motoko stable variable type safety of canister upgrades

Newly deployed Motoko canisters now embed the Candid interface and Motoko stable signatures in the Wasm module.
`dfx deploy` and `dfx canister install` will automatically check

	1) the backward compatible of Candid interface in both upgrade and reinstall mode;
	2) the type safety of Motoko stable variable type in upgrade mode to avoid accidentally lossing data;

See https://smartcontracts.org/docs/language-guide/compatibility.html[Upgrade compatibility] for more details.

=== feat: Unified environment variables across build commands

The three canister types that use a custom build tool - `assets`, `rust`, and `custom` - now all support the same set of environment variables during the build task: 

* `DFX_VERSION` - The version of DFX that was used to build the canister.
* `DFX_NETWORK` - The network name being built for. Usually `ic` or `local`.
* `CANISTER_ID_{canister}` - The canister principal ID of the canister `{canister}` registered in `dfx.json`.
* `CANISTER_CANDID_PATH_{canister}` - The path to the Candid interface file for the canister `{canister}` among your canister's dependencies.
* `CANISTER_CANDID_{canister}` (deprecated) - the same as `CANISTER_CANDID_PATH_{canister}`.  This is provided for backwards compatibility with `rust` and `custom` canisters, and will be removed in dfx 0.10.0.
* `CANISTER_ID` - Same as `CANISTER_ID_{self}`, where `{self}` is the name of _this_ canister.
* `CANISTER_CANDID_PATH` - Same as `CANISTER_CANDID_PATH_{self}`, where `{self}` is the name of _this_ canister.

=== feat: Support for local ledger calls

If you have an installation of the ICP Ledger (see https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/rosetta-api/ledger_canister#deploying-locally[Ledger Installation Guide]), `dfx ledger balance` and `dfx ledger transfer` now support
`--ledger-canister-id` parameter.

Some examples:
[source, bash]
----
$ dfx ledger \
  --network local \
  balance \
  --ledger-canister-id  rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
1000.00000000 ICP

$ dfx ledger \
  --network local \
  transfer --amount 0.1 --memo 0 \
  --ledger-canister-id  rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai 8af54f1fa09faeca18d294e0787346264f9f1d6189ed20ff14f029a160b787e8
Transfer sent at block height: 1
----

=== feat: `dfx ledger account-id` can now compute canister addresses

The `dfx ledger account-id` can now compute addresses of principals and canisters.
The command also supports ledger subaccounts now.

[source, bash]
----
dfx ledger account-id --of-principal 53zcu-tiaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai
dfx ledger --network small02 account-id --of-canister ledger_demo
dfx ledger account-id --of-principal 53zcu-tiaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai --subaccount 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
----

=== feat: Print the full error chain in case of a failure

All `dfx` commands will now print the full stack of errors that led to the problem, not just the most recent error.
Example:

[source]
----
Error: Subaccount '00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000' is not a valid hex string
Caused by:
  Odd number of digits
----

=== fix: dfx import will now import pem files created by `quill generate`

`quill generate` currently outputs .pem files without an `EC PARAMETERS` section.
`dfx identity import` will now correctly identify these as EC keys, rather than Ed25519.

=== fix: retry on failure for ledger create-canister, top-up, transfer

dfx now calls `transfer` rather than `send_dfx`, and sets the created_at_time field in order to retry the following commands:

* dfx ledger create-canister
* dfx ledger top-up
* dfx ledger transfer

=== feat: Remote canister support

It's now possible to specify that a canister in dfx.json references a "remote" canister on a specific network,
that is, a canister that already exists on that network and is managed by some other project.

Motoko, Rust, and custom canisters may be configured in this way.

This is the general format of the configuration in dfx.json:
[source, json]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "<canister name>": {
      "remote": {
        "candid": "<path to candid file to use when building on remote networks>",
        "id": {
          "<network name>": "<principal on network>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

The "id" field, if set for a given network, specifies the canister ID for the canister on that network.
The canister will not be created or installed on these remote networks.
For other networks, the canister will be created and installed as usual.

The "candid" field, if set within the remote object, specifies the candid file to build against when
building other canisters on a network for which the canister is remote.  This definition can differ
from the candid definitions for local builds.

For example, if have an installation of the ICP Ledger (see https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/rosetta-api/ledger_canister#deploying-locally[Ledger Installation Guide])
in your dfx.json, you could configure the canister ID of the Ledger canister on the ic network as below.  In this case,
the private interfaces would be available for local builds, but only the public interfaces would be available
when building for `--network ic`.
[source, json]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "ledger": {
      "type": "custom",
      "wasm": "ledger.wasm",
      "candid": "ledger.private.did",
      "remote": {
        "candid": "ledger.public.did",
        "id": {
          "ic": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
        }
      }
    },
    "app": {
      "type": "motoko",
      "main": "src/app/main.mo",
      "dependencies": [ "ledger" ]
    }
  }
}
----

As a second example, suppose that you wanted to write a mock of the ledger in Motoko.
In this case, since the candid definition is provided for remote networks,
`dfx build` (with implicit `--network local`) will build app against the candid
definitions defined by mock.mo, but `dfx build --network ic` will build app against
`ledger.public.did`.

This way, you can define public update/query functions to aid in local testing, but
when building/deploying to mainnet, references to methods not found in `ledger.public.did`
will be reports as compilation errors.

[source, json]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "ledger": {
      "type": "motoko",
      "main": "src/ledger/mock.mo",
      "remote": {
        "candid": "ledger.public.did",
        "id": {
          "ic": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
        }
      }
    },
    "app": {
      "type": "motoko",
      "main": "src/app/main.mo",
      "dependencies": [ "ledger" ]
    }
  }
}
----

=== feat: Generating remote canister bindings

It's now possible to generate the interface of a remote canister using a .did file using the `dfx remote generate-binding <canister name>|--all` command. This makes it easier to write mocks for local development.

Currently, dfx can generate .mo, .rs, .ts, and .js bindings.

This is how you specify how to generate the bindings in dfx.json:
[source, json]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "<canister name>": {
      "main": "<path to mo/rs/ts/js file that will be generated>",
      "remote": {
        "candid": "<path to candid file to use when generating bindings>"
        "id": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
----

== Motoko

Updated Motoko from 0.6.20 to 0.6.21.

= 0.9.0

== DFX

=== feat!: Remove the wallet proxy and the --no-wallet flag

Breaking change: Canister commands, except for `dfx canister create`, will make the call directly, rather than via the user's wallet. The `--no-wallet` flag is thus removed from `dfx canister` as its behavior is the default.

When working with existing canisters, use the `--wallet` flag in conjunction with `dfx identity get-wallet` in order to restore the old behavior.

You will need to upgrade your wallet and each of your existing canisters to work with the new system.  To do so, execute the following in each of your dfx projects:
[source, bash]
----
dfx wallet upgrade
dfx canister --wallet "$(dfx identity get-wallet)" update-settings --all --add-controller "$(dfx identity get-principal)"
----
To upgrade projects that you have deployed to the IC mainnet, execute the following:
[source, bash]
----
dfx wallet --network ic upgrade
dfx canister --network ic --wallet "$(dfx identity --network ic get-wallet)" update-settings --all --add-controller "$(dfx identity get-principal)"
----

=== feat: Add --add-controller and --remove-controller flags for "canister update-settings"

`dfx canister update-settings` previously only let you overwrite the entire controller list; `--add-controller` and `--remove-controller` instead add or remove from the list.

=== feat: Add --no-withdrawal flag for "canister delete" for when the canister is out of cycles

`dfx canister delete --no-withdrawal <canister>` can be used to delete a canister without attempting to withdraw cycles.

=== fix: set RUST_MIN_STACK to 8MB for ic-starter (and therefore replica)

This matches the value used in production and is meant to exceed the configured 5 MB wasmtime stack.

=== fix: asset uploads will retry failed requests as expected

Fixed a defect in asset synchronization where no retries would be attempted after the first 30 seconds overall.

== Motoko

Updated Motoko from 0.6.11 to 0.6.20.

* Implement type union/intersection
* Transform for-loops on arrays into while-loops
* Tighten typing rules for type annotations in patterns
* Candid decoding: skip vec any fast
* Bump up MAX_HP_FOR_GC from 1GB to 3GB
* Candid decoder: Trap if a principal value is too large
* Eliminate bignum calls from for-iteration on arrays
* Improve scheduling
* Improve performance of bignum equality
* Stable signatures: frontend, metadata, command-line args
* Added heartbeat support

== DFX

=== feat: "rust" canister type

You can now declare "rust" canisters in dfx.json.
[source, json]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "canister_name": {
      "type": "rust",
      "package": "crate_name",
      "candid": "path/to/canister_name.did"
    }
  }
}
----

Don't forget to place a `Cargo.toml` in your project root.
Then dfx will build the rust canister with your rust toolchain. 
Please also make sure that you have added the WebAssembly compilation target.

[source, bash]
----
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
----

You can also create new dfx project with a default rust canister.

[source, bash]
----
dfx new --type=rust <project-name>

=== chore: updating dfx new template

Updates dependencies to latest for Webpack, and updates config. Additionally simplifies environment variables for canister ID's in config.

Additionally adds some polish to the starter template, including a favicon and using more semantic html in the example app

=== feat: environment variable overrides for executable pathnames

You can now override the location of any executable normally called from the cache by specifying
an environment variable. For example, DFX_ICX_PROXY_PATH will specify the path for `icx-proxy`.

=== feat: dfx deploy --mode=reinstall <canister>

`dfx deploy` can now reinstall a single canister, controlled by a new `--mode=reinstall` parameter.
This is destructive (it resets the state of the canister), so it requires a confirmation
and can only be performed on a single canister at a time.

`dfx canister install --mode=reinstall <canister>` also requires the same confirmation,
and no longer works with `--all`.

== Replica

The included replica now supports canister_heartbeat.  This only works with rust canisters for the time being,
and does not work with the emulator (`dfx start --emulator`).

= 0.8.3

== DFX

=== fix: ic-ref linux binary no longer references /nix/store

This means `dfx start --emulator` has a chance of working if nix is not installed.
This has always been broken, even before dfx 0.7.0.

=== fix: replica and ic-starter linux binaries no longer reference /nix/store

This means `dfx start` will work again on linux.  This bug was introduced in dfx 0.8.2.

=== feat: replaced --no_artificial_delay option with a sensible default.

The `--no-artificial-delay` option not being the default has been causing a lot of confusion.
Now that we have measured in production and already applied a default of 600ms to most subnets deployed out there,
we have set the same default for dfx and removed the option.

== Motoko

Updated Motoko from 0.6.10 to 0.6.11.

* Assertion error messages are now reproducible (#2821)

= 0.8.2

== DFX

=== feat: dfx canister delete can now return cycles to a wallet or dank

By default `dfx canister delete` will return cycles to the default cycles wallet.
Cycles can be returned to a designated canister with `--withdraw-cycles-to-canister` and
cycles can be returned to dank at the current identity principal with `--withdraw-cycles-to-dank`
and to a designated principal with `--withdraw-cycles-to-dank-principal`.

=== feat: dfx canister create now accepts multiple instances of --controller argument

It is now possible to create canisters with more than one controller by
passing multiple instances of the `--controller parameter to `dfx canister create`.

You will need to upgrade your wallet with `dfx wallet upgrade`, or `dfx wallet --network ic upgrade`

=== feat: dfx canister update-settings now accepts multiple instance of --controller argument

It is now possible to configure a canister to have more than one controller by
passing multiple instances of the `--controller parameter to `dfx canister update-settings`.

=== feat: dfx canister info and dfx canister status now display all controllers

=== feat!: dfx canister create --controller <controller> named parameter

Breaking change: The controller parameter for `dfx canister create` is now passed as a named parameter,
rather than optionally following the canister name.

Old: dfx canister create [canister name] [controller]
New: dfx canister create --controller <controller> [canister name]

=== fix: dfx now respects $DFX_CONFIG_ROOT when looking for legacy credentials

Previously this would always look in `$HOME/.dfinity/identity/creds.pem`.

=== fix: changed dfx canister (create|update-settings) --memory-allocation limit to 12 GiB

Updated the maximum value for the --memory-allocation value to be 12 GiB (12,884,901,888 bytes)

== Cycles Wallet

- Module hash: 9183a38dd2eb1a4295f360990f87e67aa006f225910ab14880748e091248e086
- https://github.com/dfinity/cycles-wallet/commit/9ef38bb7cd0fe17cda749bf8e9bbec5723da0e95

=== Added support for multiple controllers

You will need to upgrade your wallet with `dfx wallet upgrade`, or `dfx wallet --network ic upgrade`

== Replica

The included replica now supports public spec 0.18.0

* Canisters can now have more than one controller
* Adds support for 64-bit stable memory
* The replica now goes through an initialization sequence, reported in its status
as `replica_health_status`.  Until this reports as `healthy`, queries or updates will
fail.
** `dfx start --background` waits to exit until `replica_health_status` is `healthy`.
** If you run `dfx start` without `--background`, you can call `dfx ping --wait-healthy`
to wait until the replica is healthy.

== Motoko

Updated Motoko from 0.6.7 to 0.6.10

* add Debug.trap : Text -> None (motoko-base #288)
* Introduce primitives for `Int` ⇔ `Float` conversions (#2733)
* Fix crashing bug for formatting huge floats (#2737)

= 0.8.1

== DFX

=== feat: dfx generate types command

[source, bash]
----
dfx generate
----

This new command will generate type declarations for canisters in dfx.json.

You can control what will be generated and how with corresponding configuration in dfx.json.

Under dfx.json → "canisters" → "<canister_name>", developers can add a "declarations" config. Options are:

* "output" → directory to place declarations for that canister | default is "src/declarations/<canister_name>"

* "bindings" → [] list of options, ("js", "ts", "did", "mo") | default is "js", "ts", "did"

* "env_override" → a string that will replace process.env.{canister_name_uppercase}_CANISTER_ID in the "src/dfx/assets/language_bindings/canister.js" template.

js declarations output

* index.js (generated from "src/dfx/assets/language_bindings/canister.js" template)

* <canister_name>.did.js - candid js binding output

ts declarations output

  * <canister_name>.did.d.ts - candid ts binding output

did declarations output

  * <canister_name>.did - candid did binding output

mo declarations output

  * <canister_name>.mo - candid mo binding output

=== feat: dfx now supports the anonymous identity

Use it with either of these forms:
[source, bash]
----
dfx identity use anonymous
dfx --identity anonymous ...
----

=== feat: import default identities

Default identities are the pem files generated by `dfx identity new ...` which contain Ed25519 private keys.
They are located at `~/.config/dfx/identity/xxx/identity.pem`.
Now, you can copy such pem file to another computer and import it there.

[source, bash]
----
dfx identity new alice
cp ~/.config/dfx/identity/xxx/identity.pem alice.pem
# copy the pem file to another computer, then
dfx identity import alice alice.pem
----

Before, people can manually copy the pem files to the target directory to "import". Such workaround still works.
We suggest to use the `import` subcommand since it also validate the private key.

=== feat: Can now provide a nonstandard wallet module with DFX_WALLET_WASM environment variable

Define DFX_WALLET_WASM in the environment to use a different wasm module when creating or upgrading the wallet.

== Asset Canister

=== fix: trust full asset SHA-256 hashes provided by the caller

When the caller provides SHA-256 hashes (which dfx does), the asset canister will no longer
recompute these hashes when committing the changes.  These recomputations were causing
canisters to run out of cycles, or to attempt to exceed the maximum cycle limit per update.

= 0.8.0

The 0.8.0 release includes updates and fixes that are primarily internal to improve existing features and functions rather than user-visible.

== DFX

=== fix: dfx identity set-wallet no longer requires --force when used with --network ic

This was intended to skip verification of the wallet canister on the IC network,
but ended up only writing to the wallets.json file if --force was passed.

=== chore: updating dependencies

* Support for the latest version of the {IC} specification and replica.

* Updating to latest versions of Motoko, Candid, and agent-rs

=== feat: Type Inference Update

* Changes to `+dfx new+` project template and JavaScript codegen to support type inference in IDE's

* Adding webpack dev server to project template

* Migration path documented at https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/release-notes/0.8.0-rn.html

= 0.7.7

Breaking changes to frontend code generation, documented in 0.8.0

== DFX

=== feat: deploy and canister install will now only upgrade a canister if the wasm actually changed

dfx deploy and dfx canister install now compare the hash of the already-installed module
with the hash of the built canister's wasm output.  If they are the same, they leave the canister
in place rather than upgrade it.  They will still synchronize assets to an asset canister regardless
of the result of this comparison.


= 0.7.6

== icx-proxy

The streaming callback mechanism now requires the following record structure for the token:
    type StreamingCallbackToken = record {
        key: text;
        content_encoding: text;
        index: nat;
        sha256: opt blob;
    };

Previously, the token could be a record with any set of fields.

= 0.7.2

== DFX

=== fix: set default cycle balance to 3T

Change the default cycle balance of a canister from 10T cycles to 3T cycles.

== Cycles Wallet

- Module hash: 1404b28b1c66491689b59e184a9de3c2be0dbdd75d952f29113b516742b7f898
- https://github.com/dfinity/cycles-wallet/commit/e902708853ab621e52cb68342866d36e437a694b

=== fix: It is no longer possible to remove the last controller.

Fixed an issue where the controller can remove itself from the list of controllers even if it's the only one,
leaving the wallet uncontrolled.
Added defensive checks to the wallet's remove_controller and deauthorize methods.

= 0.7.1

== DFX

=== feat: sign request_status for update call

When using `dfx canister sign` to generate a update message, a corresponding
request_status message is also signed and append to the json as `signed_request_status`.
Then after sending the update message, the user can check the request_status using
`dfx canister send message.json --status`. 

=== fix: wallet will not proxy dfx canister call by default

Previously, `dfx canister call` would proxy queries and update calls via the wallet canister by default.
(There was the `--no-wallet` flag to bypass the proxy and perform the calls as the selected identity.)
However, this behavior had drawbacks, namely each `dfx canister call` was an inter-canister call
by default and calls would take a while to resolve. This fix makes it so that `dfx canister call` no longer
proxies via the wallet by default. To proxy calls via the wallet, you can do
`dfx canister --wallet=<wallet-id> call`.

=== feat: add --no-artificial-delay to dfx replica and start

This change adds the `--no-artificial-delay` flag to `dfx start` and `dfx replica`.
The replica shipped with dfx has always had an artificial consensus delay (introduced to simulate
a delay users might see in a networked environment.) With this new flag, that delay can
be lessened. However, you might see increased CPU utilization by the replica process.

=== feat: add deposit cycles and uninstall code

This change introduces the `deposit_cycles` and `uninstall_code` management canister
methods as dedicated `dfx canister` subcommands.

=== fix: allow consistent use of canisters ids in canister command

This change updates the dfx commands so that they will accept either a canister name
(sourced from your local project) or a valid canister id.

= 0.7.0

== DFX

=== feat: add output type to request-status

This change allows you to specify the format the return result for `dfx canister request-status`.

=== fix: deleting a canister on a network removes entries for other networks

This change fixes a bug where deleting a canister on a network removed all other entries for
the canister in the canister_ids.json file.

=== feat: point built-in `ic` network provider at mainnet

`--network ic` now points to the mainnet IC (as Sodium has been deprecated.)

=== feat: add candid UI canister

The dedicated candid UI canister is installed on a local network when doing a `dfx canister install`
or `dfx deploy`.

=== fix: Address already in use (os error 48) when issuing dfx start

This fixes an error which occurred when starting a replica right after stopping it.

=== feat: ledger subcommands

dfx now supports a dedicated `dfx ledger` subcommand. This allows you to interact with the ledger
canister installed on the Internet Computer. Example commands include `dfx ledger account-id` which
prints the Account Identifier associated with your selected identity, `dfx ledger transfer` which
allows you to transfer ICP from your ledger account to another, and `dfx ledger create-canister` which
allows you to create a canister from ICP.

=== feat: update to 0.17.0 of the Interface Spec

This is a breaking change to support 0.17.0 of the Interface Spec. Compute & memory allocation values
are set when creating a canister. An optional controller can also be specified when creating a canister.
Furthermore, `dfx canister set-controller` is removed, in favor of `dfx canister update-settings` which
allows the controller to update the controller, the compute allocation, and the memory allocation of the
canister. The freezing threshold value isn't exposed via dfx cli yet, but it may still be modified by
calling the management canister via `dfx canister call aaaaa-aa update-settings`

=== feat: add wallet subcommands

dfx now supports a dedicated `dfx wallet` subcommand. This allows you to interact with the cycles wallet
associated with your selected identity. For example, `dfx wallet balance` to get the cycle balance,
`dfx wallet list-addresses` to display the associated controllers & custodians, and `dfx wallet send <destination> <amount>`
to send cycles to another wallet.

=== feat: Updated to Public Interface 0.17.0

=== feat: The wallet_create_canister method now takes a single record argument, which includes canister settings.

=== fix: Return correct content type and encoding for non-gz files.

=== fix: Updated frontend for changes to canister creation interface.

= 0.7.0-beta.3

== DFX

=== fix: assets with an unrecognized file extension will use content-type "application/octet-stream"

= 0.7.0-beta.2

== DFX

=== feat: synchronize assets rather than uploading even assets that did not change

DFX will now also delete assets from the container that do not exist in the project.
This means if you stored assets in the container, and they are not in the project,
dfx deploy or dfx install will delete them.

== Asset Canister

=== Breaking change: change to store() method signature

- now takes arguments as a single record parameter
- must now specify content type and content encoding, and may specify the sha256

= 0.7.0-beta.1

== DFX

=== fix: now deletes from the asset canister assets that no longer exist in the project

=== feat: get certified canister info from read state #1514

Added `dfx canister info` command to get certified canister information. Currently this information is limited to the controller of the canister and the SHA256 hash of its WASM module. If there is no WASM module installed, the hash will be None.

== Asset Canister

=== Breaking change: change to list() method signature

- now takes a parameter, which is an empty record
- now returns an array of records

=== Breaking change: removed the keys() method

- use list() instead

= 0.7.0-beta.0

== DFX

=== feat: webserver can now serve large assets

= 0.6.26

== DFX

=== feat: add --no-wallet flag and --wallet option to allow Users to bypass Wallet or specify a Wallet to use for calls (#1476)

Added `--no-wallet` flag to `dfx canister` and `dfx deploy`. This allows users to call canister management functionality with their Identity as the Sender (bypassing their Wallet canister.)
Added `--wallet` option to `dfx canister` and `dfx deploy`. This allows users to specify a wallet canister id to use as the Sender for calls.
`--wallet` and `--no-wallet` conflict with each other. Omitting both will invoke the selected Identity's wallet canister to perform calls.

=== feat: add canister subcommands `sign` and `send`

Users can use `dfx canister sign ...` to generated a signed canister call in a json file. Then `dfx canister send [message.json]` to the network.

Users can sign the message on an air-gapped computer which is secure to host private keys.

==== Note

* `sign` and `send` currently don't proxy through wallet canister. Users should use the subcommands with `dfx canister --no-wallet sign ...`.

* The `sign` option `--expire-after` will set the `ingress_expiry` to a future timestamp which is current plus the duration.
Then users can send the message during a 5 minutes time window ending in that `ingress_expiry` timestamp. Sending the message earlier or later than the time window will both result in a replica error.

=== feat: implement the HTTP Request proposal in dfx' bootstrap webserver. +
And add support for http requests in the base storage canister (with a default to `/index.html`).

This does not support other encodings than `identity` for now (and doesn't even return any headers). This support will be added to the upgraded asset storage canister built in #1482.

Added a test that uses `curl localhost` to test that the asset storage AND the webserver properly support the http requests.

This commit also upgrades tokio and reqwest in order to work correctly. There are also _some_ performance issues noted (this is slower than the `icx-http-server` for some reason), but those are not considered criticals and could be improved later on.

Renamed the `project_name` in our own generated assets to `canister_name`, for things that are generated during canister build (and not project generation).

=== feat: add support for ECDSA on secp256k1

You can now a generate private key via OpenSSL or a simlar tool, import it into dfx, and use it to sign an ingress message.

[source, bash]
----
openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -out identity.pem
dfx identity import <name> identity.pem
dfx identity use <name>
dfx canister call ...
----

== Asset Canister

=== feat: The asset canister can now store assets that exceed the message ingress limit (2 MB)

* Please note that neither the JS agent nor the HTTP server have been updated yet to server such large assets.
* The existing interface is left in place for backwards-compatibility, but deprecated:
** retrieve(): use get() and get_chunk() instead
** store(): use create_batch(), create_chunk(), and commit_batch() instead
** list(): use keys() instead

== DFX

- feat: add option to specify initial cycles for newly created canisters (#1433)

Added option to `dfx canister create` and `dfx deploy` commands: `--with-cycles <with-cycles>`.
This allows the user to specify the initial cycle balance of a canister created by their wallet.
This option is a no-op for the Sodium network.

[source, bash]
----
dfx canister create --with-cycles 8000000000 some_canister
dfx deploy --with-cycles 8000000000
----

Help string:
[source, bash]
----
Specifies the initial cycle balance to deposit into the newly
created canister. The specified amount needs to take the
canister create fee into account. This amount is deducted
from the wallet's cycle balance
----

- feat: install `dfx` by version or tag (#1426)

This feature adds a new dfx command `toolchain` which have intuitive subcommands.
The toolchain specifiers can be a complete version number, major minor version, or a tag name.

[source, bash]
----
dfx toolchain install 0.6.24 # complete version
dfx toolchain install 0.6    # major minor
dfx toolchain install latest # tag name
dfx toolchain default latest
dfx toolchain list
dfx toolchain uninstall latest

- fix: onboarding related fixups (#1420)

Now that the Mercury Alpha application subnetwork is up and we are getting ready to onboard devs, the dfx error message for wallet creation has changed:
For example,
