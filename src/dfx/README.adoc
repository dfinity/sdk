== Developing

Run `nix-shell` in this directory to bring the right version of `rustc` and
`cargo` into scope. Inside the shell use `cargo` to build and test the Rust
packages (crates).

== Installing from source

If you want to install `dfx` from source via nix, you can run, in the top level directory,

[source,bash]
nix-env -iA dfx.standalone -f .

To create the tarball that would be uploaded as part of a release, run

[source,bash]
nix-build ci/ci.nix -A publish.dfx-tarballs.linux

or

[source,bash]
nix-build ci/ci.nix -A publish.dfx-tarballs.darwin

and look in `result/dfx-latest.tar.gz`.
