The `new_project_*/` directories contain all the files of a new project. These are tar gzipped at build time
and injected into the binary.

The following strings are replaced:

- `{project_name}` / `+__project_name__+` => the project name.
- `{dfx_version}` => the DFX version used to create the project.

Also, files that start with `+++__dot__+++` will be replaced with `.`.
