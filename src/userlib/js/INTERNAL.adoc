=== How to build and use locally

In this repo:

[source,bash]
cd src/userlib/js  # You are here
npm install
npm run build
pwd  # Keep this
cp -rf . $(dfx cache show)

Alternatively, it might be easier to simply create a symlink;

[source,bash]
rm -rf $(dfx cache show)/js-user-library
ln -s src/userlib/js $(dfx cache show)/js-user-library

Then you just need to run `npm run build` when you change the code. You can also use
`npm run build -- --watch` for a quick watch mode.
