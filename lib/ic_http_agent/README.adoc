= Public Spec

== Goal
This library contains typings and utility functions dealing with the public spec and the HTTP
client. It might be shared in the future but for now is separated for the purpose of testing and
development.

== References
The latest version of the https://hydra.dfinity.systems/latest/dfinity-ci-build/dfinity/dfinity.docs.x86_64-linux/dfinity/spec/public/index.html[public spec] is available internally on hydra.
