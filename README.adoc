= DFINITY SDK

== Using The Mock DFX Locally
The mock DFX binary is kept on a separate branch. To use it follow these steps:

. Make a clone of this repository. If you haven't made a clone, this command line will do so:
[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/dfinity-lab/sdk.git
cd sdk

. Make sure your repository is up to date. If you just made a clone for the first time, you can
skip this step.
[source,bash]
git fetch origin

. Checkout the `dfx-mock` branch. If you want to experiment you can create a local branch
(optional).
[source,bash]
git checkout origin/dfx-mock

. Enter a Nix shell that contains `dfx`:
[source,bash]
cd dfx
nix-shell demo.nix

. You can now run `dfx` directly from your shell.
[source,bash]
dfx help

. Done. Good job!
