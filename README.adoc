== Using The Mock DFX Locally
The mock DFX binary is kept on a separate branch. To use it follow the steps:

1. Use a clone of this repository. If you haven't set a clone, this command line will do so:
[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/dfinity-lab/sdk.git
cd sdk

1. Make sure your repository is up to date. If you just set a clone for the first time, you can skip
this step.
[source,bash]
git fetch origin

1. Checkout the `dfx-mock` branch into a local branch. A local branch isn't necessary but makes it
easier to manage if you want to experiment.
[source,bash]
git checkout -B dfx-mock origin/dfx-mock

1. Build the binary using `nix-build`:
[source,bash]
(cd dfx && nix-build)

1. This will show you a long log, with the last line being a path that contains the output, e.g.
`/nix/store/ja40izh5md7h51djq42y9a1j7ffzc4g4-dfinity-sdk-dfx`. The binary will be `bin/dfx` in this
path, e.g. `/nix/store/ja40izh5md7h51djq42y9a1j7ffzc4g4-dfinity-sdk-dfx/bin/dfx`.

1. It is recommended to use this path to create an alias:
[source,bash]
alias dfx=/nix/store/ja40izh5md7h51djq42y9a1j7ffzc4g4-dfinity-sdk-dfx/bin/dfx

1. Done. Good job!
