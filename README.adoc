= DFINITY SDK

== Using The Mock DFX Locally
The mock DFX binary is kept on a separate branch. To use it follow these steps:

1. Make a clone of this repository. If you haven't made a clone, this command line will do so:
[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/dfinity-lab/sdk.git
cd sdk

1. Make sure your repository is up to date. If you just set a clone for the first time, you can skip
this step.
[source,bash]
git fetch origin

1. Checkout the `dfx-mock` branch into a local branch. A local branch isn't necessary but makes it
easier to manage if you want to experiment.
[source,bash]
git checkout -B dfx-mock origin/dfx-mock

1. Enter a Nix shell that contains `dfx`:
[source,bash]
cd dfx
nix-shell demo.nix

1. Done. Good job!
