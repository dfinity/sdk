= DFX Distribution and Installation

== Overview

`dfx` is the SDK's official CLI tool, which allows user to create, deploy and manage projects with the Internet Computer. It is currently compiled into a single static binary (per platform) which includes all assets necessary for it to run (including, for example, other binaries that it writes to disk).

This document covers how the `dfx` binary should be distributed and versioned on the web. It covers how a user is expected to install the `dfx` binary, bootstrap and use it for the first time.

Managing binaries and `dfx` versions locally on the user machine is covered by <<./version-management.adoc>>.

== Installation

Multiple distributions channels can be used to get the `dfx` binary installed on a user's machine. The user could go to https://sdk.dfinity.org to have a list of options available for them.

=== Shell

The user launches their terminal to download and install the binary locally. The user runs the following line (or similar) in the shell (multiple variants could be made available for fish, powershell or others):
[source,bash]
----
curl https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh | sh -
----

A sha256 of the `install.sh` script should be provided to allow the user to verify its veracity.

This does not require root access, but might explain to the user how to add the binary to their path variable.

=== Direct Download

The user downloads the binary directly, with an URL scheme looking like this:

https://sdk.dfinity.org/dfx/${VERSION}/${PLATFORM}-${ARCH}/dfx-${V_VERSION}.{EXT}

.URL Variables
|===
| Variable | Description

|`VERSION` | The version of DFX (e.g. `1.2.3`. Can also be a tag such as `latest` or `next`.
|`V_VERSION` | The version of DFX. Cannot be tagged.
| `PLATFORM` | `linux` or `macos`
| `ARCH` | `x86_64` currently.
| `EXT` | `gz` or `zip`.
|===

Example: https://sdk.dfinity.org/dfx/1.2.0/linux-x86_64/dfx-1.2.0.gz

The user can then install that binary wherever they please.

=== Installer Download

**This section is out of scope for developer network.**

Various installers should be made available for different platforms. For example, on macOS, a user could download a `pkg` file that installs `dfx` directly for them.

This could be distributed at the same location as other versions, replacing the `EXT` variable above with the extension of the installer the user should be looking for.

=== Package Manager

**This section is out of scope for developer network.**

It would be useful for the user to use the package manager they already have.

For example, the following package managers should be supported:

. `brew`. On Mac, this is the most common package manager. No local compilation is necessary to use it, and it can be a binary distribution.
. `npm`. Most users working with frontends will have npm available, and it is available on almost every platform.
. `dpkg` and `apt-get`. Plus other linux package managers.

The actual names of the package managers officially supported is currently to be determined (out of scope of this document).

=== Github releases

The user could go to GitHub and download a release directly. This would be very similar to a direct download but would be part of the github releases.

=== Using the Internet Computer

**This section is out of scope for developer network.**

Once the IC launches, the `dfx` binary could also be available through a canister's static asset. The user could then use a special command to download and install the binary on their machine, from the IC directly.

== Distribution

This section details how to build and deploy the various distributions.

=== Release Tagging

Tagging a release (on `git`) using the exact tag format `v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}[-{PRERELEASE}]` would lead CI to build a release build of `dfx`, and run the e2e tests on it. After doing that, the CI process would upload it to some cloud storage to be made available directly through direct download.

Once the binaries are available for users to download, nothing needs to be done. All package managers should always verify and download the latest version.

=== Package Version Tagging

**This section is out of scope for developer network.**

In addition to direct version numbers, the user can use the following tags to download a version of `dfx`:

. `latest`. The latest stable version of `dfx`.
. `next`. An unstable beta of the next version of `dfx`.

These tags should be available on package managers that support them (e.g. `npm install dfx@next`).

=== Package Version Listing

**This section is out of scope for developer network.**

Using the URL `https://sdk.dfinity.org/dfx/index.{html,json}` should list all available packages, in either an HTML human pleasant format, or a json machine readable one.

The JSON schema could look like this:
[source,json]
----
{
  "tags": {
    "latest": "1.2.3",
    "next": "2.0.0-beta.1"
  },
  "versions": [
    "1.0.0",
    "1.0.1",
    "1.0.2",
    "1.1.0",
    "1.2.0",
    "1.2.1",
    "1.2.2",
    "1.2.3",
    "2.0.0-beta.0",
    "2.0.0-beta.1"
  ]
}
----

== TO BE DETERMINED

What remains to be done prior to the final 1.0.0 release:

. Find a proper name for the package managers namespace. Hopefully something unique to all managers so users can use the same name (e.g. `npm install @dfinity/dfx` and `brew install @internet-computer/dfx`).
. Figuring out which package managers on linux we want to support and how to support them.
. Lay out the plan for using a canister for distributing `dfx`.
. Figure out if we want to do LTS for some versions.
. Finish out of scope sections in this document.
