= SDK Versioning And Cache Management
v0.1, 2019-08-29

-- DRAFT

== Overview
In order to use the SDK, the user has to download a version of `dfx` for their platform. Normally that means installing the latest version and using it, but the end user might be working on a project that was using an older version of `dfx`.

For example, a user could have created a project with `dfx` v0.1, but the latest is v1.0 and the user is not ready to upgrade their project just yet.

This document details the design and decisions made to solve the problem of having multiple `dfx` versions, and how upstream dependencies integrate with `dfx`.

== User-facing Version
The version of `dfx` is the only version the user should be aware of. Any upstream version will be hidden behind the `dfx` version.

For example, assuming `v1.1.5` and `v1.2.3` of `dfx` are supported stable versions, with unstable being `v1.3.0-beta.1`, and assuming a version of `dfx` could be released with bug fixes that affect both the previous stable, current stable, and unstable releases, without changes to `dfx` itself we should release a `v1.1.6`, `v1.2.4` and `v1.3.0-beta.2` versions of `dfx` containing `dfx` with the fix included.

This means the user would never actually see the version of `dfx` that they are running.

== Installing `dfx`
The user should initially download the SDK by using the following command:
[source,bash]
curl https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh | sh

This will install a binary compatible with your operating system, and add it to `/usr/local/bin`(or equivalent).footnote:disclaimer[Other systems, such as `brew`, `dpkg` or simply downloading a binary directly, should be made available.]

This binary contains a number of things:

. The global CLI. This is a CLI made to manage the cache, read the project file if necessary, and forward any calls to a versioned CLI.
. A tar gz release file containing a distribution versioned with the latest (available) version of the SDK. This tar file includes the versioned CLI, the Motoko compiler, the node manager and client, and any other necessary binaries.

== Version Resolution

The `dfx` global CLI then tries to find the version it should use (in order);

. If a `DFX_VERSION` environment variable is set, use that version directly. If that version is not available in the cache, report the error and do not continue.
. If there is a local `dfx` configuration file, it will use the version of the SDK specified in it (the `dfx_version` field). If that version is not available in the cache, it will try to download it from the Internet. If there is no connection, report the error and do not continue.
. If there is an Internet connection, to a maximum of once a week, `dfx` will reach out to `sdk.dfinity.org` to find the latest version available.
. If there is a user-level cache available, `dfx` will use the latest version already downloaded by the user that is not newer than the `dfx` global CLI version.
. Finally, the global `dfx` comes versioned and will use that version number as a last resort. If that version is not part of the cache, it will use its internal tar file to bootstrap the user level cache.

The global CLI then defers the call to a local, user-level cached, versioned CLI.

This whole process implies that:

. The CLI will always create a new project using the latest available client and SDK.
. The CLI will still work without an Internet connection.
. The global CLI only needs to be updated on major changes; either the `cache` command changes, or a URL needs to be updated. If a new version needs to be downloaded we can also tell the user how to perform the upgrade.

== Upgrade Subcommand
An `upgrade` command can be made available to ping our servers, download the latest release, install it in the user-level cache, and update the project's `dfx_version` field (if in a project) to the new version. If no Internet is available at that time it should error out.

A migration script should also be included between two versions to upgrade the project. This is out of scope for version 1.0.

== Versions
=== Operators
Semantic versioning operators should be supported in the `dfx_version` field. For example, using the following configuration file should allow the user to use any `dfx` version between 1.0.0 and less than 1.4:
[source,json]
{
  "dfx_version": ">=1.0.0 <1.4.0"
}


=== Directories
Having a directory (starting with either `.`, `~` or `/`) in the `dfx_version` field should be allowed to let the user (and most importantly our own integration tests) use a custom version of the installed binaries. No verification other than having the versioned CLI in it should be necessary.

=== Tags (_optional_)
We might want to have tracks of software that the user can use, resolving to versions through the server. The following tags could be made available from the start:

. `latest`. The latest stable version.
. `unstable`. The next alpha, beta or RC version.
. `lts`. The last Long Term Supported version, if such a version exists.

By default, prior to creating a project, the `latest` field will be used when contacting the servers to gather the latest stable version.

== Remote Commands
Commands relating to wallet, key management, upgrade and deployment of canisters, and other commands that affect a remote network (either the main network or a hosted test network) should validate that the version of the SDK is compatible with the version of the network being used remotely.

A few ways of doing this can be considered:

. The HTTP API has a call to get the version, and we consider any delta X to be incompatible. 2 major versions is normally a good delta if we implement a 1 major version deprecation policy, but 1 major version could also work. This implies that the client and SDK are loosely versioned together.
. The HTTP API has a call that lists all versions of the SDK it is backward compatible with.
. The HTTP API stays backward compatible forever.

There could be other schemes that work. This is out of scope for this particular proposal, but should be addressed prior to launching the main network.

== URL Scheme
`sdk.dfinity.org` should have a well-defined URL scheme that will avoid regressions:

.URL Schemes
|===
| URL | Description

| `sdk.dfinity.org/install.{sh,bash,fish,bat,...}` | should return a shell script that installs the
global `dfx` CLI according to platform and shell environment.
| `sdk.dfinity.org/v/` | Root of all the versions. The `index.html` should list all available
versions.
| `sdk.dfinity.org/v/1.2.3/x86_64-darwin.tgz` | The release for version 1.2.3 for OSX.
| `sdk.dfinity.org/tags/` | Root of all tags released.
| `sdk.dfinity.org/tags/latest/manifest.json` | The manifest file containing the version number and
any flags necessary to get the version currently tagged latest.
|===

== Cache
A cache directory will exist on the user's home folder. On Linux and OSX, it will likely be in `$HOME/.cache/dfinity`, while on Windows would likely be in `C:\Users\$USER\AppData\Local\DFINITY`.

That cache folder should contain `./v/$VERSION/` folders for each version downloaded.

=== Upkeep
A `cache` subcommand should be available to users to manage their cache. Example of subcommands:
[source,bash]
----
dfx cache clear  # Delete the cache folder entirely.
dfx cache list  # List all version installed.
dfx cache install 1.2.3  # Download and install version 1.2.3 in the cache
dfx cache delete 1.2.3  # Delete all the cache elements for version 1.2.3
----

Because of the delegation between the global and versioned CLI, the `cache` subcommand should be defined in the global CLI.
