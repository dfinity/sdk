## Details

### Update the Replica Version

Before making a new release, try to update the replica to the latest version
by running the [update-replica] workflow.

### Create the Release Branch

Create a release branch from `master`, for example `release-0.15.3`. If you create a new patch version make sure there will be no breaking changes included.

This branch will be used to create beta releases as well as the final release.

### Update the changelog

Open a PR to master.  Roll the changelog by adding a new header for the
new dfx version underneath the "# Unreleased" header.  Further changes to dfx
should be added under the "#Unreleased" header, unless they are ported to
the release branch.

### Create Beta Releases

1. Check out the release branch.
1. Run the release script, for example `./scripts/release.sh 0.15.3-beta.1`
1. Open a PR from the branch pushed by the previous to the release branch,
obtain CR approval, and merge the PR.
    - The release script will wait for you to do this
    - It will then create and push a tag
    - This triggers the [publish][publish-workflow] workflow
1. Wait for the [publish][publish-workflow] workflow to create the GitHub release
from the last commit on the release branch.
1. Update the GitHub release
    - Copy/paste the changelog section for the new version into the release notes
    - Set the "Prerelease" flag
1. Announce the release to #eng-sdk
    - Post a message like this, linking to the GitHub release notes:
        > dfx 0.15.3-beta.1 is available for manual installation and testing.
        >
        > ```bash
        > DFX_VERSION=0.15.3-beta.1 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
        > ```
        >
        > See also release notes.
1. Repeat the above steps until ready to promote the latest beta.

### Open a Draft PR to update the Portal

You can do this step while the beta releases are being tested.

- Add a link to the [release-notes-table]
- Update the sdk submodule

Obtain approval, but do not merge the PR yet.

This PR is a draft in order to help remind the reviewer not to merge it.

### Create the Final Release

Once the beta releases are ready to be promoted:

1. Check out the release branch
2. Run the release script, for example `./scripts/release.sh 0.15.3`
3. Follow the same steps as for the beta releases

### Open a PR to promote the release

1. Create a new branch from the release branch, for example `release-0.15.3-promote`.
1. Update the [version manifest][public-manifest]:
    - Set `.tags.latest` to the new dfx version
    - Remove the beta releases from the `versions` array
1. Open a PR from this branch to master

Obtain approval, but do not merge this PR yet.

### Open a PR to Update the Motoko Playground allow-list

You can do it either by using GitHub UI ([broadcast-frontend-hash-workflow])
or by running the following command:

```bash
gh workflow run "broadcast-frontend-hash.yml" -f dfx_version=<n.n.n>
```

Obtain approval, but do not merge this PR yet.

### Promote the release

You should now have three open, approved PRs:

- Update the portal
- Promote the release
- Update the Motoko Playground allow-list

Merge all three PRs.

### Post to the forum

Post a message to the forum, linking to the GitHub release notes.

### Open a PR to update the examples repo

Open a PR in the examples repo to update the dfx version used by default in the examples.
The PR should update DFX_VERSION in these two files:

- [provision-darwin.sh]
- [provision-linux.sh]
