= Release process

This document describes the release process for `dfx`, with step-by-step instructions, information about automation, and a checklist.

== Overview

Before starting the release process, the team should conduct a brief Go/No-Go release review to evaluate the current state of fixes and features ready to be included in a release candidate.
After reviewing the list of fixes and features, the team will decide whether to proceed with staging a build.

For now, our release process is driven by the DFINITY foundation SDK team. Future work needs to be done to separate the build and release process to run fully on open systems.

If the new release is given the Go green light, two people who are familiar with the process—a *driver* and a *validator*—use the steps in this document to stage or promote a release candidate.

The *validator* should be the person most familiar with the process and be able to assist with debugging or resolving issues if the *driver* building the release runs into trouble.

A successful release is the result of coordination between automation, manual steps performed by team members, and a validation process.
Our goal is to update this document with the latest information as we iterate to improve the release process.

=== Participants
- Driver / Primary
- Validator / Secondary

=== Prerequisites

Before you begin, verify the following prerequisites for the release process *driver*:

- You must have a GitHub account and access to the `+dfinity+` organization and core repositories like the `sdk` repository
+
For information about setting up a GitHub account, see link:https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account[Signin up for a GitHub account]
To get permission for your account to access `+dfinity-lab+` and `+dfinity+` repositories, see link:https://www.notion.so/How-to-Get-Github-Access-68c9ad72b5974fa9bbec003592677d02[How to get GitHub access).
If you run into any issues accessing repositories, you can contact IT using the `#help-it` Slack channel and sending a message to `@firstresponder`.

- You must have VPN access to the DFINITY VPN.
+
If you don't have a VPN connection set up for your computer, you'll need to follow the instructions in link:https://www.notion.so/How-to-get-VPN-access-to-our-data-center-services-1c9b123152d740508eec25e7ac982259[How to get VPN access to our data center services].

=== Preliminary validation

Verify the general stability of the master branch before attempting to create a release candidate.

. Use this link:https://github.com/dfinity-lab/sdk/commits/master[link]
to verify:
.. Is `master` green?
.. Was `master` red recently or flaky?
+

image:is-master-green.png[]

=== Update your repository with merged commits

. Connect to VPN.
. Open a terminal and `cd` into your local copy of the `sdk` repo.
. Check out the `master` branch and pull merged commits from the remote in your working directory by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
git checkout master && git pull
----

At this point, you are ready to build a release candidate.
There are two ways you can build a release candidate:
- Using the <<script,SCRIPT-BASED release process>> to automate the build process and skip manual testing.
- Using the <<manual,MANUAL STEPS release process>> to build and test the release.

[[script]]
== SCRIPT-BASED release process

To use the release script to automate building the release candidate:

. Run the following command and substitute `<n.n.n>` with the version number for this release candidate:
+
[source, bash]
----
./scripts/release.sh <n.n.n>
----
+
For example, if releasing 0.7.0, you would run the following command:
+
....
./scripts/release.sh 0.7.0
....
. Follow the prompts displayed to complete the release process.

After running this command to build the release candidate, follow the steps in <<post-build,Notification and post-build validations>> to complete the release process.

[[manual]]
== MANUAL STEPS release process

The manual release process provides full instructions for building and testing the release candidate binaries to ensure everything is working before making a release available to internal or external developers.

=== Build DFX

Verify that you can build DFX from the `+master+` branch without errors.

. Verify you're connected to VPN, if necessary.
. Build the `dfx` binary by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
export sdk_rc="$(nix-build ./dfx.nix -A build --option extra-binary-caches https://cache.dfinity.systems)"
export dfx_rc="$sdk_rc/bin/dfx"
----
+
The `nix-build` command can take a while to complete.
Wait for it to be done.
These commands create the binary then stores the binary in a shell variable.
. Make sure the `$dfx_rc` variable points to a real file by running the following command:
+
```
test -x $dfx_rc \
    && echo 'Please proceed.' \
    || echo 'Cant find executable $dfx_rc'="$dfx_rc"
```
+
You should see 'Please proceed' returned.
. Delete the existing `dfx` cache to ensure you're not using a stale binary.
+
[source, bash]
----
$dfx_rc cache delete
----
. Ensure `dfx` and `replica` are not running in the background by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
ps -ef | grep -E 'replica|dfx' | grep -v grep
----
+
If there are any `replica` or `dfx` processes running, use the `kill` command to terminate them.

=== Validate the default project

Verify that you can build, deploy, and call the default `hello_world` project without errors.

. Generate a default new project and change to the project directory by running the following commands:
+
[source, bash]
----
$dfx_rc new hello_world
cd hello_world
----
. Start the local `replica` as a background process by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
$dfx_rc start --clean --background
----
. Create, build, and install canisters by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
$dfx_rc deploy
----
. Call the canister and verify the result by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
$dfx_rc canister call hello_world greet everyone
----
. Save the canister URLs as shell variables, then print them by running the following commands:
+
[source, bash]
----
export hello_world_candid_url="http://localhost:8000/candid?canisterId=$($dfx_rc canister id hello_world)"
export hello_world_assets_url="http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=$($dfx_rc canister id hello_world_assets)"
----
. Open a web browser and clear your cache or switch to Private Browsing/Incognito mode.
. Open the following URL in your web browser:
+
[source,bash]
----
echo "$hello_world_assets_url"
----
+
. Verify that you are prompted to type a greeting in a prompt window.
.. Type a greeting, then click *OK* to return the greeting in an alert window.
.. Verify there are no errors in the console by opening the Developer Tools.
+
For example, in the browser, right-click, then click Inspect and select Console to check for errors and warnings.
Warnings can be ignored.

. Verify the Candid UI by opening the following URL in your web browser:
+
[source, bash]
----
echo "$hello_world_candid_url"
----
+
.. Verify UI loads, then test the greet function by entering text and clicking *Call* or clicking *Lucky*,
.. Verify there are no errors in the console by opening the Developer Tools.
+
For example, in the browser, right-click, then click Inspect and select Console to check for errors and warnings.
Warnings can be ignored.
. Stop the replica by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
$dfx_rc stop
----
. Delete the test project by running the following commands:
+
[source, bash]
----
cd ..
rm -rf hello_world
----

==== Update the version

. Set the new version in a temporary environment variable.
+
For example, replace `<n.n.n>` with a specific version number:
+
[source, nix-shell]
----
export NEW_DFX_VERSION=<n.n.n>
----
. If you're not already there, navigate back to the top-level of the `sdk` repo.
. Enter the sdk `nix` development environment by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
nix-shell --option extra-binary-caches https://cache.dfinity.systems
----
. Create a new branch for your changes by running the following command:
+
[source, nix-shell]
----
git switch -c $USER/release-$NEW_DFX_VERSION
----
. Update the first `version` field in `src/dfx/Cargo.toml` to be equal to `$NEW_DFX_VERSION`
. Apply these changes to `Cargo.lock` by running the following command:
+
[source, nix-shell]
----
cargo build
----
. Append the new version to `public/manifest.json` by appending it to the `versions` list.
+
For example:
+
[source, json]
----
{
    "tags": {
        "latest": "0.6.0"
    },
    "versions": [
        "0.5.15",
        "0.6.0",
        "n.n.n"
    ]
}
----
+
*Ensure* `tags.latest` remains the same.
. Exit `nix-shell` to continue.

==== Create a pull request and tag

. Create a pull request with the above changes by running the following commands:
+
[source, bash]
----
git add --all
git commit --signoff --message "chore: Release $NEW_DFX_VERSION"
git push origin $USER/release-$NEW_DFX_VERSION
----
. After pushing, click the link in the console to go to your new branch in GitHub, then click *Create Pull Request*.
. Have the validator review and approve the PR.
. Apply the `automerge-squash` label.
+
image:automerge-label.png[]

. Wait for the pull request to get merged.
+
NOTE: Depending on the number of jobs queued up, this step can take 45 to 60 minutes to complete.

. Switch to the `stable` branch by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
git switch stable
----
. Pull the remote `stable` branch into your local `stable` branch by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
git pull origin stable
----
. Pull the merged changes into the `stable` branch by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
git pull origin master --ff-only
----
. Create a new tag by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
git tag --annotate $NEW_DFX_VERSION --message "Release: $NEW_DFX_VERSION"
----
. Verify the tag points to the correct version and includes annotation by running the following commands:
+
[source, bash]
----
git log
git describe --always
----
. Push the tag by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
git push origin $NEW_DFX_VERSION
----
+
CI will only publish `dfx` from the latest commit from the `stable` branch when that commit is tagged with a version.
. Make sure the release tag is visible https://github.com/dfinity-lab/sdk/releases[here].
. Push the `stable` branch by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
git push origin stable
----
+
Pushing the branch second is an optimization.
Hydra will spur into action when `stable` advances, so if the branch is already tagged, it won't require a second fetch.

[[post-build]]
== Notification and post-build validation

. Wait for the automatic slack message to
link:https://dfinity.slack.com/archives/CUXGQBABF/p1594954197000100[_#build-notifications_]
about the successful publishing of the `dfx` tarballs.

. Install the build using the `DFX_VERSION=<version>` environment variable.
. Run through the link:https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/local-quickstart.html[_Quick start - Local development_] steps.
. Run through link:https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html#ping-the-network[Check the connection to the network] and link:https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html#net-deploy[Register, build, and deploy the application] steps to deploy to the network.
. Notify link:https://app.slack.com/client/T43F9UHS5/CGA566TPV[#eng-sdk] team members that the new build is ready for manual installation and testing.
+
Remind the SDK and Apps teams to add information about _features and fixes_ for release notes to their issues or PRs and to apply the changelog label to have the information included in the release notes.
. Notify the link:https://forum.dfinity.org[Developer Forum] community if there are breaking changes.
+
If a release is known to have changes that are not backward-compatible, create a forum post to describe the change and any instructions for migrating to the new release.
+
Depending on the change, the notification might need to be posted in more than one topic channel.
For example, changes to the external network for onboarded developers are currently posted in link:https://forum.dfinity.org/t/network-status-updates/928[Network status and updates] on the link:https://forum.dfinity.org[DFINITY Developer Forum].

== Promote a release candidate to production

. Verify that release notes and documentation are ready for public consumption.
. Open the `public/manifest.json` file in a text editor.
. Under the `tags` key, change the version number associated with the `latest` key.
+
For example:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "tags": {
        "latest": "n.n.n"
    }
}
----
. Prepare a PR for the manifest by running the following commands:
+
[source, bash]
----
git switch -c <YOUR_NAME>/update-n.n.n-latest
git add --all
git commit --message "chore: Update the manifest latest to n.n.n "
git push origin <YOUR_NAME>/update-n.n.n-latest
----
. After pushing, click the link in the console to go to your new branch in GitHub, then click *Create Pull Request*.
. Have the validator review and approve the PR, then merge to `master`.
. Verify the Linux and Darwin (macOS) builds are available for download from \https://download.dfinity.systems/sdk/dfx/n.n.n/architecture/dfx-n.n.n.tar.gz.
+
Linux—Replace _n.n.n_ with the new version number and _architecture_ with `x86_64-linux`. For example, the following link would download version 0.6.1 for Linux:
+
\https://download.dfinity.systems/sdk/dfx/0.6.1/x86_64-linux/dfx-0.6.1.tar.gz[]
+
Darwin (macOS)—Replace _n.n.n_  with the new version number and _architecture_ with `x86_64-darwin`. For example, the following link would download version 0.6.1 for macOS:
+
\https://download.dfinity.systems/sdk/dfx/0.6.1/x86_64-darwin/dfx-0.6.1.tar.gz[]
+
CI Hydra:
+
link:https://hydra.dfinity.systems/jobset/dfinity-ci-build/sdk-release[]

Add a description and publish the tag for the latest release
https://github.com/dfinity-lab/sdk/releases/new?tag=${NEW_DFX_VERSION}

== Release documentation

link:https://github.com/dfinity/docs[Documentation repo]

. Tag the documentation using `git tag -a <version> -m <documentation-archive-message>`.
. Publish the tag on the remote server using `git push origin <tagname>`.
. Deploy updated documentation using Netlify.

== Requirements and properties

 - Semi-automation
 - Consistent delivery
 - Validation
 - Rollback
 - Guardrails
 - Flexibility

== Build mechanism

Our build process is described in the `release.nix` derivation.
The `release.nix` derivation mainly invokes the `dfx-release` derivation passing the annotated tag on HEAD (which happens right now to be the stable branch).
The `dfx-release` derivation builds the release binaries and files for each platform and generates a manifest for S3 that includes the tag name.
The release tag allows us to keep a directory structure with all past and upcoming releases in S3.

==  CI

CI release-related operation is split into two jobsets:

 - Generation and publishing of 'install.sh' and 'manifest.json'.
 - Tagging of a commit to release, building and publishing the necessary executables and files for supported platforms.

==  Manifest

We utilize a manifest to indicate to users (and in particular to our installer and dfx executable) available and supported versions for download.
The manifest allows us to rollback a release or remove a release from the list of supported releases.
See link:../specification/version_management{outfilesuffix}[Version Management] for details on the format of the manifest.

The manifest is generated when a patch is applied on master by the CI.

== Installer

The installer is generated when a patch is applied on the `master` branch by the CI.

==  Changelog

A candidate changelog is generated automatically using the respective tool (under scripts directory).
Currently, the release notes are updated manually in github.

== Publishing of artifacts

We now summarize the release process.
Our first step is to ensure the proper and valid state of the `master` branch.
Next, we update `cargo` and the manifest accordingly.
We then create and push an annotated tag on the `stable` branch, generate the changelog.
The product and SDK team members can then inspect, clarify, and develop the changelog to ensure it is appropriate for public
consumption.
After ensuring the proper artifacts are available in S3, we can now publish them by updating the manifest.

== TODOs and improvements
. version from the tag
. release stress tests
. valid json test for the manifest
