= Release Process

This document describes the release process for DFINITY SDK. We review the
mechanism, the automation provided and the checklist process.

== Overview

Releases are done following the checklist rule: preferrably by two people
familiar with the process, i.e. 1 driver 1 validator. The validator should be
the person most familiar with the process. A successful release is the result of
coordination between automation, manual labor and validation. We should improve
the release process continuously. In the following mechanism section we describe
the operation of how to get a new release out.

== Checklist

* Participants
** Driver
** Validator
** CI (system up)
* Is master green?
* Was master red recently or flaky?
* Follow process:
** Update versions
*** `dfx/Cargo.toml`
*** `public/manifest.json` (only adding the version to the list)
*** `src/agent/javascript/package.json` (`version` key)
*** `src/agent/javascript/package-lock.json`
*** `sdk/src/bootstrap/package-lock.json`
*** `sdk/src/bootstrap/package.json`
*** `src/ic_identity_manager/Cargo.toml`
*** `src/agent/rust/Cargo.toml`
*** `Cargo.lock` (can also run `cargo build`)
** Update manifest to include new version; *Ensure* latest remains the same
** Create a pull request with the above 2 changes and get the validator to approve it
** Switch to stable branch and `git pull origin stable`
** Run `git pull origin master --ff-only`
** Create tags with `git tag -a version -m " Release: version"`
** Double check the tag points correctly and is an annotated one: `git log` and  `git describe --always`
** Push tag first to avoid triggering hydra incorrectly `git push origin version`
** Push the stable branch now `git push origin stable`
** Check hydra
** Prepare PR for manifest
** Update release notes
** Update manifest once all builds are done (see https://blobules.dfinity.systems/sdk-release/ and https://hydra.dfinity.systems/jobset/dfinity-ci-build/sdk-release)
***  Linux
***  Darwin

Notes: We assume *upstream* is `origin`.


== Requirements & Properties

 - Semi-automation
 - Consistent delivery
 - Validation
 - Rollback
 - Railguards
 - Flexibity

== Mechanism

===  Build

Our build process is described in the nix derivation release.nix. This
mainly invokes the dfx-release derivation passing the annotated tag on HEAD
(which happens right now to be the stable branch). Along with building release
binaries and files for each platform, it generates a manifest for S3 providing
it with the tag name. This allows us to keep a directory structure with all past
and upcoming releases in S3.

===  CI

CI release-related operation is split into two jobsets:

 - Generation and publishing of 'install.sh' and 'manifest.json'
 - Tagging of a commit to release, building publishing necessary executables and files for supported platforms


===  Manifest

We utilize a manifest to indicate to users (and in particular to our installer
and dfx) available and supported versions for download. This allows us to
rollback a release or remove a release from the list of supported releases. See
link:../specification/version_management{outfilesuffix}[Version Management] for
details on the format of the manifest.

The manifest is generated when a patch is applied on master by the CI.

=== Installer

The installer is generated when a patch is applied on master by the CI.

===  Changelog

A candidate changelog is generated automatically using the respective tool
(under scripts directory). Right now the release notes need to be updated
manually in github.

=== Publishing of Artifacts

=== Process

We now summarize the release process. Our first step is to ensure the proper and
valid state of master branch. Then we update cargo and the manifest
accordingly. We create and push an annotated tag on stable. Meanwhile, we
generate the changelog, inspect, clarify and develop it appropriately for public
purview. Ensuring the proper artifacts are available in S3, we can now publish
them, by updating the manifest.

== TODOs and Improvements
. version from the tag
. release stress tests
. valid json test for the manifest
