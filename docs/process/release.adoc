= Release process

This document describes the release process for the DFINITY SDK, with step-by-step instructions, information about automation, and a checklist.

== Overview

Before starting the release process, the team should conduct a brief Go/No-Go release review to evaluate the current state of fixes and features ready to be included in a release candidate.
After reviewing the list of fixes and features, the team will decide whether to proceed with staging a build.

If the new release is given the Go green light, two people who are familiar with the process—a *driver* and a *validator*—use the checklist in this document to stage or promote a release candidate.

The *validator* should be the person most familiar with the process and be able to assist with debugging or resolving issues if the *driver* building the release runs into trouble.

A successful release is the result of coordination between automation, manual steps performed by team members, and a validation process.
Our goal is to update this document with the latest information as we iterate to improve the release process.

== Checklist
Use this checklist to prepare a release candidate.

=== Participants
- Driver
- Validator

=== Setup
. Connect to VPN.
+
If you don't have a VPN connection set up for your computer, you'll need to follow the instructions in link:https://www.notion.so/How-to-get-VPN-access-to-our-data-center-services-1c9b123152d740508eec25e7ac982259[How to get VPN access to our data center services].
. Open a terminal and `cd` into your local copy of the `sdk` repo.
. Checkout the `master` branch and pull from remote.
+
[source, bash]
----
git checkout master && git pull
----

=== Releasing a New Version

==== Preliminary Validation
. Use this link:https://github.com/dfinity-lab/sdk/commits/master[link]
to verify:
.. Is `master` green?
.. Was master red recently or flaky?

==== Validate the Build and UI

===== Verify that the default `hello_world` project can be built, deployed, called in a terminal, and viewed in a browser.
. Build the `dfx` binary
+
[source, bash]
----
nix-build ./dfx.nix -A build --option extra-binary-caches https://nix.dfinity.systems
----
+
[width="80%",cols="2,<68%", frame=none]
|===
| | The above command will print logs to the console.
The last line printed is the directory of build output i.e.
`/nix/store/7qsrb3pikzam301h6khjzwpg35ry7miz-dfinity-sdk-rust-unknown`
|===
// (_for the rest of these instructions, assume that `dfx` is a reference to
// `result/bin/dfx or wherever the binary was built with this command`_)
. Create a temporary `alias` for the binary to use in succesive steps by appending `/bin/dfx` to the above path
*(Replace the path below with the one from your console)*
+
[source, bash]
----
alias dfx=/nix/store/7qsrb3pikzam301h6khjzwpg35ry7miz-dfinity-sdk-rust-unknown/bin/dfx
----
. Verify the binary version.
+
[source, bash]
----
dfx --version
----
. Delete the existing dfx cache to ensure you're not using a stale binary.
+
[source, bash]
----
dfx cache delete
----
. Build the javascript agent
+
[source, bash]
----
nix-build . -A agent-js --option extra-binary-caches https://nix.dfinity.systems
----
+
[width="80%",cols="2,<68%", frame=none]

. Verify the default front-end in a browser.
.. In a new incognito or private window navigate to the default localhost address and port `8000`
(specified in the `dfx.json` configuration file).
.. Append `?canisterId=ic:<YOUR-CANISTER-IDENTIFIER>` with the canister identifier for the
`hello_world_assets` canister to the URL (for example, `http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=ic:02000000000000000000000000000000000153`).

| | CI will only publish dfx from the latest commit from the stable branch when that commit is tagged with a version.
|===

. Push the `stable` branch by running:
+
[source, bash]
----
git push origin stable
----
+
[width="80%",cols="2,<68%", frame=none]

== Requirements and properties

 - Semi-automation
 - Consistent delivery
 - Validation
 - Rollback
 - Guardrails
 - Flexibility

== Build mechanism

Our build process is described in the `release.nix` derivation.
The `release.nix` derivation mainly invokes the `dfx-release` derivation passing the annotated tag on HEAD (which happens right now to be the stable branch).
The `dfx-release` derivation builds the release binaries and files for each platform and generates a manifest for S3 that includes the tag name.
The release tag allows us to keep a directory structure with all past and upcoming releases in S3.

==  CI

CI release-related operation is split into two jobsets:

 - Generation and publishing of 'install.sh' and 'manifest.json'.
 - Tagging of a commit to release, building and publishing the necessary executables and files for supported platforms.

==  Manifest

We utilize a manifest to indicate to users (and in particular to our installer and dfx executable) available and supported versions for download.
The manifest allows us to rollback a release or remove a release from the list of supported releases.
See link:../specification/version_management{outfilesuffix}[Version Management] for details on the format of the manifest.

The manifest is generated when a patch is applied on master by the CI.

== Installer

The installer is generated when a patch is applied on the `master` branch by the CI.

==  Changelog

A candidate changelog is generated automatically using the respective tool (under scripts directory).
Currently, the release notes are updated manually in github.

== Publishing of artifacts

We now summarize the release process.
Our first step is to ensure the proper and valid state of the `master` branch.
Next, we update `cargo` and the manifest accordingly.
We then create and push an annotated tag on the `stable` branch, generate the changelog.
The product and SDK team members can then inspect, clarify, and develop the changelog to ensure it is appropriate for public
consumption.
After ensuring the proper artifacts are available in S3, we can now publish them by updating the manifest.

== TODOs and improvements
. version from the tag
. release stress tests
. valid json test for the manifest
and supported versions for download.
The manifest allows us to rollback a release or remove a release from the list of supported releases.
See link:../specification/version_management{outfilesuffix}[Version Management] for details on the format of the manifest.
