== Objective
////
:required:

In a few sentences, describe the key objectives. Why do we need this feature?
What are we trying to accomplish?

Just a few sentences.
////

A developer wants to test multi-user interaction, switch between
testing and production principals for the same project, create easily
dummy principals for testing and development purposes. Thus, they must
have access to multiple principals and can relate them with signing
services or key pairs directly to enable signing of requests.


We propose a simple, forward and backward compatible to some extent,
user profile file hierarchy structure to provide access to
principals across projects.


(Note that CI/Testing/Automation is out of scope.)


== Contribution

This design answers the following questions:

* If a user creates a new principal where is it placed?
* When a user makes a request in a particular project which principal is used by default?
* How do we mitigate data migration?
* How do we ensure identity related data is usable across most dfx/replica versions?

:optional:
Include as much information as necessary here to understand the design. Include
glossary if necessary in this section. Links to examples, related projects
or other design docs. Any previous/current version of this feature.

Do not write ideas about how to solve the problem here.

This is a good place for requirements and constraints.
////

=== Setup

Currently, dfx allows a user to define multiple projects. Each project
describes one or more canisters for a user defined version of the
Internet Computer.

=== Definitions

* Identity:

An identity is a construct that denotes the set of claims of an entity
about itself. An entity is anything issuing requests directly or
indirectly to the Internet Computer (IC). Identification is the
procedure whereby an entity claims a certain identity, while
verification is the procedure whereby that claim is
checked. Authentication is the assertion of an entityâ€™s claim to an
identity.

* Role:

A role represents the set of actions an entity equipped with that role
can exercise.

* Principal:

A principal describes the security context of an identity, namely any
identity that can be authenticated along with a specific role. In the
case of the Internet Computer this maps currently to the identities
that can be authenticated by a canister.

* Identifier

An identifier is a sequence of bytes/string utilized as a name for a
principal. That allows a principal to be referenced.

* (Principal) Profile identifier

To denote principals from a user's perspective across projects and to
decouple them from the canister representation we use the term of
principal profile identifier, as a special identifier.

- Examples: A user Bob may have administrative or developer access
  rights, that is their role; their principal profile identifier would
  be Bob, while for a canister X the principal identifier could be
  0x2324303493...

* User:

A user is an external party that interacts with the IC replica via dfx
(program). A user can be a person, a script, Continuous Integration.


* Signing Provider

Provides access to signing functionality. Can be a key for instance.

* Access Files

Files pertaining information about accessing and using a signing provider.


* Identity Hierarchy:

The file system storage representation of principals and access to related signing
providers: private keys, hardware management keys, gpg key handles,
via a persisted file hierarchy.


=== Requirements

. User may have different principals (profiles) and be able to share
them between the same project or different projects
. As such a user may reuse signing providers between projects (in the
future allow multiple signing providers per principal)

=== Constraints

From the canister execution's perspective, user principal identifiers
(self-authenticating ones) are [to be] derived and specific to the
canister id. This means that principals need to be referenced by the
user independently of the canister.


=== Related Art
////
:optional: But recommended.

Link to other products available as comparatives to this design. For example,
if another tool has a similar feature, list pros/cons/shortcomings of that tool.
////

All of the related work has different underlying goals and
architecture, however provide possible paths, tools or choices to
consider.

*  AWS CLI

AWS is focused on keeping credentials, as its use case is
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-where[AWS
CLI Documentation].  AWS focuses on spawning production services all
under a particular role, at a relatively trusted system, and utilizes
session or ephemeral keys, thus usually making use of environment
variables directly. Furthermore, AWS CLI lacks the concept of
projects. As a result the cli stores all credentials locally in
`~/.aws/credentials` separate from the user implementation. AWS
provides the notion of named
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html[profiles].
Furthermore, it provides a series of authentication strategies beyond
credentials.

* Google cloud services CLI

Similar to AWS. More focused on API keys that are provided to the
application.

*  GPG

Data of GPG are kept usually under `~/.gnupg` In general it uses its
own file extensions and data format and organization. (Specifically, two
are used gpg and kbx.) GPG encrypts all private key files (and
compresses them). Also keeps track of a trust database with key
relations for validation. It also keeps track of a randomness pool and
lock files.

Keys are concentrated into key-rings (secret and public). Revocation
certificates are kept individually however. Filenames in that case use
the fingerprint of the respective key.

To provide convenient usage it provides `gpg-agent`, which stores
decrypted keys in memory for the duration of its session. For more
information see gnupg
link:https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/GPG-Configuration.html[configuration].

*  SSH

OpenSSH stores credentials or data necessary to interface with a
authenticating and signing service concentrated under a .ssh folder
per user. A user may configure which file is to be used per case or
provide it during invocation. It also provides an ssh-agent, that is
being accessed for ssh sessions.



== Expected User/Developer Experience

////
:required: Either User and/or Developer experience should be explained.

Describe what
////

User seamlessly switches between principals. A user is informed on
the principal they are issuing a request under. They are able to alter
principals, add new ones and remove existing ones, assign access to
new signing keys.


=== Security Considerations
////
:optional:

How will this feature impact security, and what needs to be done to keep it
secure. Considerations should include:
  - User input sanitization
  - Existing security protocols and standards
  - Permissions, Access Control and capabilities
  - Privacy, GDPR considerations, etc.
  - Anything else that can affect security and privacy.
////

==== Security models:

We suppose two different models to indicate different decisions and
mitigation results. In both models, the adversary is not able to gain
access to the key points related to the desired principal.

===== Adversary local access

 First, an adversary that has local access to the system without
 actual user, superuser or root access. The adversary can thus not
 access the identity hierarchy files.

The adversary wins the security game by gaining access to any secrets
utilized by the signing providers or by issuing signed requests to the
IC under any of the principals of the local identity.

===== Adversary user system access

The adversary has access to the system in the role of the user or an
administrator that can run programs with the same capabilities as the
user and access the identity hierarchy. Absent the user providing the
pass-phrase the adversary does not have access to all signing
facilities and can not issue requests. However, the adversary learns
about principals and relations with signing functionality.

The adversary wins the security game by issuing signed requests to the
IC under any of the principals of the local identity. The security
parameter depends on the passphrase used to encrypt the access files.

Note that in this model we assume that access files are encrypted --
the default.

==== Path

File permissions need to be set to allow only user (or root/superuser)
access. Files containing secret information, such as access files
described below, should be encrypted by default. User input containing
pass-phrases should use a proper prompt (see existing crates).



=== Performance Considerations
////
:optional:

How will the feature affect speed and performance. Will there be a need to
benchmark the feature (and if so, how)? Is there any considerations to keep
in mind for avoiding and preventing future regressions?
////

N/A.


== Prototype
////
:optional:

If a proof of concept is available, include a link to the files here (even if
it's in the same PR).
////


== Detailed Design
////
:required:

Full design on how to implement the feature. Use this section to also describe
why some simpler approaches did not work. Mention other things to watch out
for during implementation.

Keep in mind that you might not be the person implementing the design.
////

Below we represent a principal by a (principal) profile identifier --
`<principal profile identifier >`. Principal identifiers from an
execution's perspective are to be canister installation
specific. However, we want a user to be able to locally refer to a
user principal across projects. Thus, for each principal we use a
local system identifier, a profile.

==== Global Profiles Structure

By default dfx provides a user cache to store various versions of
dfinity executables, and other data. However, it is temporary in
nature. Thus, we introduce a sibling .dfinity directory for data to be
persisted. Here we denote this directory with `<dfinity>`.

The identity hierarchy is represented by a series of files under
`<dfinity>/identity/`. At the root of `<dfinity>/identity/` there
is `<dfinity>/identity/metadata.json`. It represents only versioning
information and any other meta-data that future versions elect to add.


For each principal `<principal profile identifier >` we assign the
following file `<cache>/identity/<principal identifier
alias>/principal.json`. This assumes that user printed principal
identifiers are valid names in the system.

[source,json]
----
{
  "version": "1.*",
  "access": {
   "key1": {
      "type": "pem",
      "path": "<file path>"
    },
   "key2": {
      "type": "hw-piv-x",
      "path": "<file path>"
    }
  }
}
----

In the future, these can easily be augmented with extra fields.

===== Note on Principals -- Principal Profiles

Recall that in the future principal identifiers will be connected to
the canister identifier. This poses a complexity as principal
identifiers as recognized by an IC replica are not simply project
specific but canister installation specific. For that reason we
introduced above the `<principal profile identifier >`. We have
several choices:

. We support principals with current identifier and preserve the
identifier post the suggested alterations to the way principal
self-authenticating identifiers shall be computed.
. We support now or in the near future principals with their
identifiers deviating per installation possibly. We expose a common
identifier to the user to handle the principal, a profile for that
principal. That is the user picks the identifier to be used by dfx for
the principal.
. We support principals with current identifier and proceed to a
breaking change introducing a profile identifier as in option 2

In summary:

* Each principal file includes the following:

- Versioning information
- Access file tree structure (each node is a file path plus access type)

* Each access file data is represented according to its type (e.g. PEM encoded)

* <cache>/identity/metadata.json
- Versioning information


===== Advantages:

The above approach ensures we do not have to invent our own data format or
concern ourselves with compression or encrypting fields individually
with different keys. It allows a user to always access relatively
easily access and backup sensitive information, improving robustness
in case of migration failure, bug or write failure.


===== Fault Tolerance

Note that if an access file is missing or an entry in the principal
data file is incorrect, the user can manually or via prompt fix the
issue, by removing the entry or assigning the key to the correct
principal. Adding extra fields or removing fields allows us to move
between versions if the need arises. The identity hierarchy is loosely
coupled with the credentials or the signing providers, allowing one to
modify it without endangering access to services or loss of secrets.


==== Local Project

We first focus on globally managing principals. See notes section for
a possible path and thoughts.

==== DFX

Each invocation of dfx should make it apparent which principal was
used for which invocation. One could consider simply exposing if a
principal is different than the default. However, that is error prone:
a user can easily move a project or continue issuing update
instructions in a controller role.


====  Agent

To ensure access to encrypted files we spawn an agent process. There
are two paths. One appears to be using the
link:https://linux.die.net/man/1/gpg-agent[gpg-agent]. Another path is
to simply spawn our own agent and provide a way to reconnect via local
socket.

One consideration for running our dedicated agent is affecting
inadvertently a user's other activities.

Note we can afford to have a not so stable agent. That is in case the
program is unable to connect to the agent we simply prompt the user
for a pass-phrase.

==== CLI commands

To expose the above functionality, we add a `principal` main
command, along with related subcommands. These expose only the current
provided functionality, yet can be easily extended.


----
 `principal` -> `new` [principal profile identifier] (default operation)
 `principal` -> `new` -> [principal profile identifier] [key type] [ --with (file/access information) ]
 `principal` -> `new` -> [principal profile identifier] -> `yubikey`
 `principal` -> `key` -> `show` [principal profile identifier(s)]
 `principal` -> `remove`[principal identifier(s)]
 `principal` -> `list`
 `principal` -> `show` [principal identifier]
----

Above [key type] can be [pem-key], [pkcs12] or [yubikey]. This can be extended
later to [gpg] or any other provider of signing functionality. Note
that pass-phrase or other sensitive information are not passed via
flags to avoid being saved into history. They are provided
interactively.

We add on each canister command a `--principal` parameter. If the user
does not point a principal, we use the default principal, which we
generate if necessary.



==== JSON vs YAML vs TOML


A consideration was given between JSON, YAML and TOML. TOML while
simple is restrictive related to future tree structures we want
represented. Yaml appears a better candidate, however it might be more
complicated. We make currently extensive usage of JSON, thus the
tentative suggestion is to use JSON and if any issues arise to proceed
to YAML in the future.


==== Crates to consider

tty pass-phrase prompt:

* https://crates.io/crates/rpassword
* https://crates.io/crates/ttyaskpass


=== Public API

Current feature discusses persisted structures and their management,
thus requires no Public Spec API changes.




=== Integration Plan
////
:optional: Required if there are interactions with other tools.

How will this feature interact with other tools? Is there any changes outside
of the SDK that are required to make this feature work? Does this feature
have integration with `dfx`?
////

There is no related work outside SDK. User profiles are supported by the identity manager, for dfx.


=== Publishing Plan
////
:optional: Required if there are new packages.

Explain which new packages will be released and published with this feature.
Include any changes to current released packages.
////

Packages affected by this change are dfx and the identity manager.

== Breaking Changes
////
:optional:

Does this feature create or require breaking changes?
////

None

=== Deprecation
////
:optional:

Does this feature deprecates any existing APIs?
////

N/A.

== Documentation
////
:required:

How will this feature be documented? Which people need to be involved?
////

Critical Stake-holders: 
Stake-holders: 
Interested Parties: (feel free to add your name)

This feature should be split into smaller passes and documented
partially as we expose more user facing sub-features. Initially, a
simple note that a user can generate a new principal is necessary, and
that this principal can be accessed in all projects that use the
latest dfx.

We should provide internal documentation as to the file structure of
the identity profiles. It is up to the discretion of the Critical
stake holders to decide if that information needs to be represented. It
is then the job of the critical stake-holders and stake-holders to
produce a user-friendly version of the documentation.

If we use the gpg-agent, we should provide `advanced user`
documentation, explaining the options under which we use the
agent. Only a single instance of the agent per session may exist and
thus we may interfere with usage of the agent.



Features to be documented:

- commands
- file structure (to be determined by stake-holders -- probably optional)
- agent (selectively)



== Roll-out / Migration
////
:optional:

How can we minimize impact to users? How do we maximize adoption?
////

There is minimal impact to the users, as they can pick to use default
principal initially. This is a "pay as you go" feature. Users using
older versions of dfx -- directly or indirectly -- are missing related
functionality, thus can not access any suggested features. Worst case,
the proposed flag or command is not recognized by the old dfx.

Migration on the other hand to future versions can be a concern due to
the dfx cache. This implies that it is the responsibility of the
program to ensure that if a past version is run over a recent
structure, the program can decide to use the existing file structure,
principal or credential, or exit with appropriate error and
instruction on how to upgrade the program and project.

Under no circumstances, should we automatically migrate a particular
file or identity hierarchy, as the migration may be run by an outdated
version of the program.


== Rollback Plan
////
:optional:

How do you plan to rollback the change if a major issue is found?
////

We preserve the default profile already provided, that supports a single private key PEM encoded.


== Maintenance and Evolution Plan
////
:required:

How do you plan to maintain this feature for the next years? Can the
APIs be cleanly evolved? Can Breaking Changes in the future be avoided?

If this is a package, how do we plan to publish and deploy it? This includes
version numbering.
////

Every persisted data structure proposed includes a version by
construction. The proposed Identity hierarchy comprises three data
types: i) meta-data ii) principal to access files mapping data iii)
access files, that provide a way to sign with a particular key. The
first two are version dependent. We should ensure a version
compatibility check is performed for each



== Work Breakdown
////
:required:

Description of the various phases and milestones, and approximate time
estimates. This is supposed to be a bullet point list, and will likely
result in one task per bullet.
////

=== Outline

We split the feature long-term life into 3 stages, that may interleave.

1. Stage 1: Basic support of current functionality: single principal per key/signing provider
2. Stage 2: Feature is deemed secure in both aforementioned models
3. Future Work: Support of new principal computation, multiple
principals per key, revocation and other future identity related
features.

=== Step by step

We further split short term work in a series of steps. Some of them
can be concurrently polished.

* State 1:

1. Rewrite current default profile such that it adheres to suggested structure
2. Ensure a file is ignored if parsing or version check fails
3. Provide a new command principal to add a new principal
4. Provide a new command principal to set a principal as default for a project
5. Provide a new command principal to remove a principal
6. Introduce encrypted access files

* Stage X

1. Setup access rights of local and global files and directories properly
2. Provide simple agent to assist with user access
3. Turn encrypted access files as the default option at this point


== Appendix

=== Notes for future consideration

==== Local Project Principal

Locally each project should persist the principal that should be used
on particular operations. Example of different operations that might
reach for different profiles.

As projects should be sharable between individuals, that information
should not lie with the project configuration or committed into
version control (git by default). Recall also that in the future
principal identifiers will be connected to canister identifier.

Thus, in each project, we may place optionally the following file

* .dfx/identity.json

[source,json]
----
{
  "version": "1.*",
  "command": [
    {
      "canister": "principal identifier"
    }
  ]
}
----


This is kept minimal. We reference the version, to aid in future
modifications. The field command and canister can be set to
default. They represent respectively the principal that should be used
when a particular <command> request issued for the corresponding
<canister>. The usual simple project profile will look like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "version": "1.*",
  "default": [
    {
      "default": "principal identifier"
    }
  ]
}
----

Repeated entries will lead to undefined behaviour.


==== CLI Amendment

We amend the CLI with the following command.

  `principal` -> `set-default` -> [principal identifier(s)]
