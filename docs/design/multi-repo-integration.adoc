== Overview
This design document explore how to setup and integrate the different repositories that
make the SDK.

== Background
There are currently multiple repos that the SDK team manages every day;

. The SDK itself (dfx);
. Documentation
. Examples
. Rust CDK

This does not include the repositories that are covered by sub-teams or with collaboration
with the Language team, like Candid, Cancan and LinkedUp.

Also, Rust and JavaScript agents are going to move to their own repositories, as well as
the bootstrap code.

The SDK repo will become the DFX repo, and run the integration with other repos.

== Expected User/Developer Experience
Developers on the SDK should be able to focus on the repo they work in, without having
multiple technologies and tools that take a lot of cognitive load or time to work.

== Detailed Design
=== Dependency Graph
The most important aspect of splitting the SDK into multiple repos is to have a clear
dependency graph between repositories. Given how we want to separate the main SDK repo
in the short term future, this graph could look like this:

[graphviz, dependency_graph, svg]
----
digraph D {

    graph [ bgcolor = transparent ]

    node [
        shape = box,
        style = filled,
        fillcolor = white,
        fontname = Helvetica,
        fontsize = 12,
        width = 1.5,
    ]

    examples [label="Examples\n(various)"]
    sdk [label="SDK\n(nix)"]
    docs [label="Documentation\n(adoc)"]
    agent_ts [label = "JavaScript Agent\n(ts)"]
    types_js [label = "Type Library\n(ts)"]
    agent_rs [label = "Rust Agent\n(rust)"]
    types_rs [label = "Type Library\n(rust)"]
    cdk_rs [label = "CDK\n(rust)"]
    bootstrap [label = "Bootstrap\n(HTML+ts)"]
    canisters [label = "D. Canisters\n(Motoko/Rust)"]

    docs -> sdk
    examples -> sdk

    sdk -> bootstrap -> agent_ts
    sdk -> agent_rs
    sdk -> types_rs
    sdk -> canisters

    agent_ts -> types_js
    agent_rs -> types_rs
    cdk_rs -> types_rs

}
----

We can emerge from this clear leaf nodes. These leafs don't benefit from using a
complex CI/CD and build system; they're mono-languistic, focused and simple libraries
used by more complex products. And distributed using their own package managers
(npm for JavaScript, crates.io for Rust).

=== Conventional Commits
All repos should follow (and enforce) conventional commits.

=== Branching
Three branches should exist in every new repository;

. `next` which is the next major version, can have breaking changes.
. `minor` which is the next minor version, cannot have breaking changes but can add
  new features. This branch is optional
. `x.y` which is the stable release (e.g. `0.5`) and may only contain patches deemed
  important to the current or previous version (e.g. security fixes).

=== Versioning
Repos should fit whatever versioning scheme seems to fit.

The only constraints would be with Agents, as they should version with the spec they follow
in mind, as they'll be more or less changed with spec changes. So an Agent following spec
0.8 should have version 0.8.0, then increment patch numbers with each releases.

=== Tests
Following a few principles:

. Each repo should test their own code using unit tests.
. Each repo should not allow PRs to be merged if unit tests are failing.
. Repos should NOT test their dependencies' code using unit tests (this is currently
  not the case).
. Each repos should have a set of integration tests with their immediate upstream
  dependency.
. True end-to-end tests become clearly the responsibility of source nodes; Docs
  (testing of their tutorials), Examples and SDK (current e2e suite).
. Ideally, each repos should have a set of tests for preventing (or deliberately
  allowing) breaking changes. Such tests could include integration testing with the
  downstream repository.

==== API Regression Testing
===== Rust
There is currently a proposal to have RustDoc outputs JSON (see
https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2963[here]) as a backend. This proposal would
allow us to setup an API extractor that works as a backward-compatiblity test, similar
in spirit to https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/rust-semverver[semverver] but more
standard and better supported (semverver hasn't been working consistently for
months).

===== TypeScript
Microsoft has been publishing API-Extractor for a while. This generates a JSON file
that can be used to validate any API changes.

===== Other
Other languages should have a way to export or test their API, depending on the
language itself. For example, a list of expected APIs in a linked object if the
language does not have good support for API extraction (e.g. C++).

== Documentation
CONTRIBUTING docs should be maintained in sync between repos. The master repo for
these templates should be either Docs, Common or a new repo for organization
specific documentation.

=== Releases
Each package would be released on their own package manager on a different (but
hopefully in sync) schedule as the other packages. For example, JavaScript code should
be released on NPM, while Rust code on crates.io.

Each release should be tagged on GitHub and could be automated easily compared to DFX
itself. Since each repo should follow conventional commits, release notes could be
automated for each repo, with the major SDK repo being the grab all overview of all
documented releases.

== Work Breakdown
The first step would be separate the different repos and validate

The current best repos to do this would be (in order):

. Rust Agent. This will validate that we can still use Hydra and Nix with a crate
  dependency that depends on a github repo.
. JavaScript Agent into 1 repo 2 packages; types and agent. This will straighten
  up the dependencies between DFX, the Agent and the packages we publish.
. Bootstrap. This will remove the direct link from DFX -> JavaScript Agent. This
  will also be a good point to add browser tests to the Bootstrap repo.

At this point this design will be validated as viable. New repos can be added, but
the current repos should remain mostly the same.
