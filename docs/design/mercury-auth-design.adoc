= Mercury Request Authentication Design Doc
// Author field:
v0.1, 2020-10-20
:draft:
:toc:

== Overview

An agent interacts with the IC by sending requests. These requests must be either anonymous or authenticated for a given user identity (or principal).
Request authentication uses digital signatures: the agent holds a private (signing) key on behalf of the user, which it uses to sign the _request id_ of each request sent to the IC.
The agent then sends the request to the IC along with the user's public (verification) key, which is linked to the user identity.
The IC verifies the signature with respect to the public key, and (if the signature verifies and the public key is linked to the principal claimed by the agent) provides the request to the canister, setting the _caller_ of the request to the claimed identity.

For request authentication to be secure and usable, the agent must enable the user to handle the keys that are linked to the identity in a way that is both secure (i.e. access to private keys is protected) as well as usable (i.e. allows the user to backup the key, use it on multiple devices, etc.)
While the pre-Mercury implementation of the agent does support request authentication, it falls short in terms of identity management.

== Background

////
:required:

Include as much information as necessary here to understand the design. Include
glossary if necessary in this section. Links to examples, related projects
or other design docs. Any previous/current version of this feature.

Do not write ideas about how to solve the problem here.
////

=== Problem Statement

The proposed design ensures that user keys are stored securely, while at the same time allowing the user to manage access to its identity safely as well as on mulitple devices.

=== Requirements

The key management in the browser agent must support the following:

* *Secure key storage*: User keys must be stored in a way that protects them from being extracted from the canister front end.
* *Safe and usable identity management*: 
 - Users can recover access to their identity even in case of device failure or loss.
 - Users can use their identity from multiple devices.
 - Users can use their identity on multiple canisters on the same device, once that device is authorized.

== Expected User/Developer Experience
////
:required: Either User and/or Developer experience should be explained.

Describe what
////

When a user, for the very first time, interacts with a canister hosted on the IC, the front page shows an option to create/import an IC identity.
When the user selects this option, the browser shows the IC identity manager where the user can create a master key (optional) and a device key (required).
A master key, once created, will be exported to cold storage.
After the identity setup is complete, the user interacts with the canister using the new IC identity.

When a user, for the first time on a new device, interacts with a canister hosted on the IC, the front page shows an option to create/import an IC identity.
When the user selects this option, the browser shows the IC identity, where the user can import the master key from cold storage, and create a new device key, authorizing the device.
After authorization is complete, the user interacts with the canister using the IC identity.

When a user interacts with another canister hosted on the IC, from a device that has been used with the IC before, the front page shows an option to use the IC identity.
When the user selects this option, the browser shows the IC identity manager, where the user can authorize the use of the identity for that canister.
After the authorization is complete, the user interacts with the canister using the IC identity.

When a user interacts with a canister on a device where they used the same canister before, the front page shows an option to "sign in".
When the user selects this option, the user interacts with the canister using the IC identity.

TODO: can you add something about the expected developer experience?

=== Technologies

==== DER encoding

We use different types of public keys to support different technologies on the client side, such as web authentication and web cryptography.
We use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#DER_encoding[DER] (a subset of ASN.1) to encode all public keys, so that the replica can unambiguously determine the types of keys used for authenticating the request.
More concretely, we follow https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8410[RFC 8410] to encode public keys for Ed25519.

==== Web authentication

https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[Web authentication (or WebAuthn)] is a W3C standard for accessing FIDO tokens.
For public-key-based credentials, the private (signature) key is stored on a FIDO token and is never exported. The web authentication API then allows a web application to obtain a signature (from the FIDO token) on a given challenge bit string.
Web authentication is supported by all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) and by many consumer devices that come with a biometric sensor (many laptops, tablets, and phones).

==== Public-key certificates

Public-key certificates are widely used for delegation of authority, such as in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509[PKI].
Effectively, one uses a signature private key `sk-a` to sign a different public key `pk-b` along with some metadata such as the expiration, and this _certificate_ is then presented (to a verifying party) by the owner of private key `sk-b` (which corresponds to the `pk-b`).
That way, the owner of `sk-a` can delegate certain authorities to the owner of `sk-b` (the verification checks the certificate using `pk-a`).

==== Cold-storage keys

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki[BIP-39] describes a format for storing private keys via a mnemonic code. BIP-39 is widely used in the area of cryptocurrencies, and most hardware wallets use it for backup of the user's private master key. The user writes the mnenomic code (consisting of words in a language of their choice) to a sheet of paper, which is stored at some secure place. The key can be restored by entering the mnemonic code.

==== Single sign-on

The web has solutions such as https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0[SAML]. They are not immediately useful for us, since they need a trusted identity provider for each user, but the user flows (being redirected to the identity provider, then back to the service provider) is already familiar to many users.

=== Considered Solutions

==== Public key encoding

The main alternative to DER is https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152[COSE], which is based on CBOR instead of ASN.1, and is used in web authentication.
The use of CBOR is the major advantage in COSE, since we use that format to encode the requests.
On the flip side, DER has better tooling support outside of the IC, as the PKCS standards are based on it. It is also easier for us to extend DER for new key formats by assigning new OIDs from our own space, whereas extending COSE requires a change to the https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml[type registry] managed by IANA.

==== Private key storage

_Storing keys in browser local storage_. If keys are stored in plain in browser local storage, the can be accessed by any code running using the same origin. This can be prevented by using web cryptography to store keys non-extractable. In both cases, keys could still be extracted by a local malware attack.
In addition, Safari's policy to delete all state of sites that have not been used in the last week means that user keys are likely to be deleted.

_Storing keys in a OS key ring_. We could provide a browser extension that stores keys in the OS key ring. While that circumvents the problems of browser local storage, it would require us to develop a browser extension/plugin for each major browser and OS, which seems infeasible in the given time frame.

==== Delegation

Besides certificates, there are two other major ways to implement delegation between public keys.

_Storing keys in canister system storage_. For each canister and user identity, a list of authorized public keys is stored in the affected canister's system state. When a user sends a request signed with some public key and claiming some identity, the IC checks whether that public key is authorized for that identity.
*Advantages*: Almost no changes to request format and canister code required.
*Disadvantages*: Agent needs additional API for key management (adding and removing), storage is used by user but paid for by canister, which means canister needs API to control the storage. That makes this solution overall more complex.

_Storing keys within canister memory_. There is no delegation in ICP, but canisters implement key management on their own, likely relative to a standardized API.
*Advantages*: No changes to replica, no changes to ICP.
*Disadvantages*: Harder to consistently integrate with Motoko (at least short term), needs support from canisters.

==== Cold-storage (master) keys

Multiple alternatives have been discussed:

* Deriving key from a password: While this is easy to use, a password-derived key does not contain sufficient entropy and is not considered secure.
* Exporting the key to an encrypted PEM file: Already clunky on a desktop, unusable on mobile.
* Hardware wallet: We cannot require each user to have one.
* Server-based solution such as oblivious PRF or threshold sharing: Not realistic in the available time.

==== Single sign-on

We previously discussed serving the identity manager in an iframe. This solution has two main challenges:

* Browsers get more aggressive in restricting what iframes can store. The iframe solution does not work in Safari and Brave, and it also does not with in Chrome and Firefox when 3rd party tracking is forbidden.
* Using web authentication from an iframe is impossible.

=== Recommended Solution 

==== Public-key encoding

All public keys are encoded in DER. That means:

* Use of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8410[RFC 8410] for encoding Ed25519 keys.
* Use of https://docs.dfinity.systems/dfinity/spec/public/index.html#signatures[DER-wrapped COSE] for web authentication keys.

We need a unambiguous encoding of different types of public keys, and DER suits out needs better than COSE.

==== Private-key storage

Wherever possible, we use web authentication to store device keys. The main reason is that web authentication allows us to keep the user's private key in secure hardware, where it cannot be extracted.
As a fallback mechanism, we keep the current solution of storing keys in browser local storage.

Web authentication does not (yet) allow signing without user consent/interaction. As that means the user would be required to interact with their device for every query that is sent to the IC, we use https://docs.dfinity.systems/dfinity/spec/public/index.html#authentication[delegation]: When loading the canister page first, the front end creates a standard Ed25519 (or a web cryptography) key that it keeps in local storage, and is used as a session key with a short expiration. It then creates a delegation (certificate) from the web authentication key to the session key. Queries are then signed with the session key, and also contain the delegation.

==== Cold-storage (master) keys

The master key is an Ed25519 key, the private key is exported and imported as a mnemonic code via BIP-39. The master key is never _stored_ in the browser. When it is created, the front end shows the mneminoc code to the user, creates a web authentication key for the device, and delegates from the master key to the device web authentication key.
When authorizing a new device, the master key is imported, the device's web authentication key is created and authorized by the master key, and the master key is again dropped from memory.

==== Single sign-on

The identity manager uses a specific origin (e.g. `identity.dfinity.network`). It is implemented as a full page, not an iframe. The identity manager uses a web authentication key and additionally keeps the following data in browser local storage:

* Auxiliary information needed to access the web authentication key
* (If available) Master public key (*not* private key)
* (If available) Delegation from the master key to the web authentication key
* List of front ends canister id authorized to use the identity, and for each front end the back end canister ids that may be accessed as well as a user-friendly free-text name of that front end

The main concept in the identity manager is that of a _delegation_. A delegation here means that some canister front end (which is served by a canister) is allowed to access *some* background canisters using as sender of the requests the principal derived from the user's master key (or if that does not exist, the user's web authentication key).
Delegations are scoped, meaning each canister front end may access only specific back end canisters. For Mercury I, the identity manager has to enforce the following rules:

* Every canister front end may access only the canister serving the front end assets and at most *one* additional canister.
* No canister may be accessed by two different front end canisters. (I.e. at any point in time, access to a canister is delegated to only *one* front end.)

The identity manager creates _delegation certificates_ when asked to do so by a canister front end that has an active delegation. A delegation certificate contains the delegate public key (supplied by the canister front end), the list of allowed targets (containing the id of the front end canister itself and at most one additional canister id), an expiration time (default 15 minutes unless configured otherwise by the user), and a signature by the web authentication key.

*Initialization*: When the user opens the identity manager (whether by visiting `identity.dfinity.network` directly or by being redirected from some canister front wnd), the identity manager checks the browser local storage for the  above data to be available. If the local storage is found to be empty, the following procedure is followed:

. The user is asked to (a) create a new master key, (b) import an existing master key, (c) proceed without master key.
  In cases (a) and (b), the respective part of the BIP-39 mechanism is used.
. Create new web authentication key, store auxiliary information in local storage
. If not (c), then after the master key is created and exported, or imported, then create delegation to the web authentication key.

*Direct visit*: If the user visits `identity.dfinity.network` directly, the identity manager shows a list of acive delegations. The user can view and delete the delegations. Optionally, the user may be allowed to set the expiration time for delegation certificates, as well as edit the free text name of that canister front end.

*Redirection*: When the user accesses a canister, and decides to use the user's IC identity, the browser is redirected to the identity manager.
First, the canister front end first generates a new (Ed25519 or better web cryptography) session key pair.
Second, the canister front end redirects the browser to `identity.dfinity.network`, passing:

* the public key
* the suggested free text name for the front end
* optionally the additional canister id that the front end wants to access

as parameters.
The identity manager then proceeds as follows:

* If no delegation for that canister front end exists, ask the user whether a new delegation shall be created.
  Let the user edit the free text name of the canister as well as the expiration.
  Create the new delegation (to the front end canister and, if provided, the additional canister requested by the front end) in the browser local storage.
* Sign a delegation with the web authentication key toward the session public key passed by the canister front end, and redirect the browser back to the canister front end, passing along the delegations and the master public key (if present, otherwise web authentication key).
  The canister front end can then proceed using the session key.

=== Public API
////
:optional: Required if there is any public API changes

List any new or current API changes. List traits, methods, arguments and any
types. A good way is to paste an example of the API in the language it will be
implemented, for example (with Rust):

[source,rust]
----
/// Confabulate the splines using reverse polarity. Can return an error if
/// the space is asynchronously stochastic.
pub fn confabulate(spline: &mut [&Spline], polarity: bool) -> Result<(), Error> {}
----

It's important to avoid implementations here and speak in general terms.
////

TODO: can you fill this in?

=== Prototype
////
:optional:

If a proof of concept is available, include a link to the files here (even if
it's in the same PR).
////

=== Security Considerations
////
:optional:

How will this feature impact security, and what needs to be done to keep it
secure. Considerations should include:
  - User input sanitization
  - Existing security protocols and standards
  - Permissions, Access Control and capabilities
  - Privacy, GDPR considerations, etc.
  - Anything else that can affect security and privacy.
////

==== Public-key encoding

Encoding the public key in DER will need an additional library in the Javascript agent. No other security impact in the agent, as only the encoding of public values is affected.

==== Private-key storage

In terms of security, web authentication is preferable over our current solution since the private key is stored in a secure hardware token instead of on the user's disk.

Session keys stored in the browser storage are (as long as we use Ed25519) again extractable by the canister front end, including code that may be injected due to a security flaw in the canister. While the session key is time-restricted by a short expiration, it could still be exfiltrated and leaked during its validity period. One countermeasure that we should implement as soon as possible is web cryptography, and storing the private key so it cannot be exported by Javascript.

==== Cold-storage (master) key

The following risks apply with respect to the master key:

* The randomness used for generating the master key must be secure. The key should use randomness from the `getRandomValues()` method of https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#Crypto-method-getRandomValues[web cryptography] to ensure the randomness is good.
* The user must keep their mnemonic code in a secret place. We should provide clear explanations.
* The key will be in the browser memory. To protect the key:
 - We ensure that the key is in memory only when it is used, and dropped immediately after the signing operation.
 - The key is not stored permanently in the browser (no local storage, IndexedDB, ...)
 - The key is only imported in the identity manager, which for Mercury is served from the Foundation-provided bootstrap server. (The bootstrap server anyway has to be trusted in the web front end.)

When the user delegates from the master key to any one canister front end, that canister front end can send requests to any canister on the IC. That way, a malicious canister front end can attack the user. This is planned to be resolved by restricting delegations to specific lists of canisters, as outlined in this https://github.com/dfinity-lab/ic-ref/pull/212[draft PR].

==== Single sign-on

One main security consideration for the identity manager affects how it is served. As we initially serve it in the same way as we serve the bootstrap, we do not add an additional trust assumption.

The second main consideration relates to cross-canister requests. If delegations for the same master key to different canisters are not scoped, then a potentially malicious or vulnerable canister front end can access any canister in the name of the user.
The main security mechanism here is _scoping_: The user explicitly restricts the validity of the delegation.
As we do not want to bother the user with checking canister ids (actually, there is no good way for a user to do those checks), we restrict the mechanism to explicitly keep the access of different front ends separate.
That way, we can mostly exclude that a malicious or vulnerable front end accesses precious user data in other canisters.
This mechanism will have to be improved in the future, to allow for controlled access sharing between different canister front ends.

=== Performance Considerations
////
:optional:

How will the feature affect speed and performance. Will there be a need to
benchmark the feature (and if so, how)? Is there any considerations to keep
in mind for avoiding and preventing future regressions?
////

Encoding the public key in DER can be implemented as a one-time operation. The encoding requires additional 12 bytes for Ed25519, and additional 19 bytes for web authentication keys.

Using web authentication for signing does not significantly impact performance on the computational side; the most significant impact comes from the user providing consent by interacting with the device. Web authentication signatures are larger than plain ones (for my example that is 238 bytes vs. 64 bytes).

Delegations do not significantly affect the performance in the agent, as this only incurs one additional signature per message. A delegation will add around 150 bytes for the session key. Overall, that means a web authentication request will be about 350 bytes longer than a transaction signed via plain Ed25519.

Handling the master public key is a sufficiently infrequent operation. Passing an additional delegation in every request adds around 150 bytes to each request using that delegation.

The identity manager is used whenever the user starts a new session. The operation itself is not expensive, but this does introduce latency in the process mostly due to redirecting the browser.

== Breaking Changes
////
:optional:

Does this feature create or require breaking changes?
////

Switching the encoding of Ed25519 keys to DER is a breaking change (or rather: switching off accepting raw Ed25519 keys is a breaking change).
We cannot deactivate raw Ed25519 keys during Sodium, as the principals sent to us by canister owners use that type of key. Therefore, we will deprecate raw Ed25519 keys during the switch from Sodium to Mercury.

=== Deprecation
////
:optional:

Does this feature deprecates any existing APIs?
////

== Documentation
////
:required:

How will this feature be documented? Which people need to be involved?
////

The interaction between agent and IC, including the exact formats, is documented in the https://docs.dfinity.systems/dfinity/spec/public/index.html[public spec].

TODO: how will we document the new authentication library for developers?

TODO: We certainly have to put up documentation explaining the master key and the identity manager to end users.

== Lifecycle

=== Integration Plan
////
:optional: Required if there are interactions with other tools.

How will this feature interact with other tools? Is there any changes outside
of the SDK that are required to make this feature work? Does this feature
have integration with `dfx`?
////

The DER-encoding of Ed25519 keys is a minor change and can be implemented after the last SDK version for Sodium and before the first SDK version for Mercury is launched.
The encoding also has to be supported in `dfx` (there is a working implementation in Eric's branch).

Web authentication is an additional feature that only needs to be supported in the browser agent.

=== Publishing Plan
////
:optional: Required if there are new packages.

Explain which new packages will be released and published with this feature.
Include any changes to current released packages.
////

=== Rollout / Migration
////
:optional:

How can we minimize impact to users? How do we maximize adoption?
////

As switching the encoding of Ed25519 keys is a breaking change for users (at least those that have a principal in Sodium), roll out of the change removing raw Ed25519 can only be done when switching from Sodium to Mercury I.

Web authentication as an additional feature can be rolled out whenever ready.

TODO: For identity manager.

=== Rollback Plan
////
:optional:

How do you plan to rollback the change if a major issue is found?
////

For DER-encoded Ed25519, if switching is impossible, then we can keep the current heuristic for decoding raw Ed25519 keys in the replica (for some further time).

If the new web authentication features do not work, we hold back on rolling them out.

=== Maintenance Plan
////
:required:

How do you plan to maintain this feature for the next years? Can the
APIs be cleanly evolved? Can Breaking Changes in the future be avoided?

If this is a service, what is the update and monitoring strategy?

If this is a package, how do we plan to publish and deploy it? This includes
version numbering.
////

TODO: Any particular plan needed for the public key encoding or the web authentication part?

TODO: Definitely needed for the identity manager

== Work Breakdown

Description of the various phases and milestones. This is supposed to be a
