== Overview

Rework the asset canister so that it can store assets that are larger than
the message ingress limit.

Also, support link:https://www.notion.so/Design-HTTP-Canisters-Queries-d6bc980830a947a88bf9148a25169613[Http Canister Queries]
by associating additional metadata with each asset, and content encodings.

== Background

The asset storage canister at present is a rudimentary key/value store of static blob data.

The update call requires passing asset contents in their entirety, which
limits their size to the message ingress limit.

The asset storage canister is written in Motoko, and as such does not have access to
(for example) compression libraries.

=== Problem Statement

The main purpose is to make it so asset content length can exceed the message ingress limit.

=== Requirements

* Can upload assets of any size (within reason)
* Support upcoming http server


== Prior Art

S3 rest interface

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html
** returns Content-Type and so forth along with the body
** Note that S3 does not directly support directory structure

== Detailed Design

=== Assets

Store per asset:

* Key
** an arbitrary string that identifies the asset
* Content type
* Content for one or more content encodings
** Content encoding
** Content blob

=== Implementation

We will implement the canister in Rust.

Note that at present the Rust CDK does not have libraries for data structures stored in stable memory.

We'll use a link:https://crates.io/crates/fat32[FAT32 library] to map a FAT32 volume onto
a block of stable memory in order to store both asset metadata and content blobs.

Directory structure on this FAT32 filesystem:

----
/meta
  hex/digits/of/asset/key
/content
  file_id.dat
----

==== The `meta` directory

Since keys are of arbitrary length and can contain characters that are not valid
in FAT32 filenames, we will convert the asset key into hex digits representing the UTF-8 bytes,
and split these hex digits into groups of 8 characters, naming directories and finally a filename.

Each files will store a single Candid record:
[source, candid]
----
record {
  content_type: text;
  file_id: text;
};
----

==== The `content` directory

At the API level, file ids are text, a temporary handle.

In practice, file ids will be numbers. To choose them, we can start with
a monotonically increasing value.


=== Considered Solutions

==== Motoko canister

* does not support things like compression libraries
* stable memory means contents can easily survive an upgrade
* need special handling for deleted assets

==== Rust canister with unstable memory

* This would be a reasonable implementation and would not require changing the interface
* requires uploading all assets on every upgrade
** but only if they are not all already there
* canister-level "upgrade" would only needed when the asset canister wasm changes

=== Public API

[source,candid]
----

type AcceptEncoding = text;
type Contents = blob;
type FileId = text;
type Key = text;
type Offset = nat;
type TotalLength = nat;

type AssetOperationKind = variant {
  // Create a new asset.  Contents will be attached later with SetContent.
  // What happens if an asset already exists, and/or has a different content type?
  // Do we leave it to the caller to Delete first?
  Create: record {
    key: Key;
    content_type: text;
  };

  // Add or change content for an asset, by content type
  SetContent: record {
    key: Key;
    content_encoding: text;
    file_id: FileId;
  };
  // Remove content for an asset, by content type
  UnsetContent: record {
    key: Key;
    content_encoding: text;
  };
  Delete: record {
    key: Key;
  };

  // Future: set up access control
  SetAcl: record {
    key: Key;
    tbd: text;
  };
  // Future: set a time after which to delete an asset
  SetExpiry: record {
    key: Key;
    tbd: text;
  };

  // Delete all assets
  Clear;

  // Delete content files that are not referenced by any asset
  // Delete empty directories
  GarbageCollect;
};

service: {

  get: (Key, vec AcceptEncoding) -> (record { contents: blob; content_type: text; content_encoding: text }) query;
  list: () -> (vec Path) query;

  // future? list: (regex or prefix) -> (vec Path) query;

  // allocate space for files
  create_files: (vec TotalLength) -> (vec FileId);

  // upload part of a file's content
  write_file(FileId, Offset, Contents) -> ();

  // Perform all operations successfully, or reject
  batch: (vec AssetOperationKind) -> ();

  // we may break out the individual operations publicly here

  // Single call to create an asset with content for a single content encoding that
  // fits within the message ingress limit.
  store: (Key, record {
                 content_type: text;
                 content_encoding: text;
                 contents: blob;} ) -> ();
}

=== Security Considerations

For the time being, security controls will continue to be:
- assets writable only by canister owner
- assets readable by anyone

=== Performance Considerations

Retrieval requires reading the content out of stable memory into a blob before
returning it.

Depending on the number of assets (files) we expect an asset canister to hold,
we may want to split up the content files into subdirectories.

The size of the stable memory block in the canister will need to be
roughly double the size required to hold only the assets, because
during upgrades all of the new assets will briefly be stored along
with all of the previous assets.

The `dfx install` process could be smarter, for example only uploading
changed assets.  This would require more metadata, such as a hash
per content type/content blob.


== Breaking Changes

This feature breaks the signature of the `store` method.

=== Deprecation

This feature deprecates the `retrieve` method.


== Documentation
////
:required:

How will this feature be documented? Which people need to be involved?
////

== Lifecycle

=== Integration Plan

The JavaScript agent will need to change in order to use the new interface.

The process that `dfx install` uses to synchronize assets to an asset canister will
be more complex.

=== Maintenance Plan
////
:required:

How do you plan to maintain this feature for the next years? Can the
APIs be cleanly evolved? Can Breaking Changes in the future be avoided?

If this is a service, what is the update and monitoring strategy?

If this is a package, how do we plan to publish and deploy it? This includes
version numbering.
