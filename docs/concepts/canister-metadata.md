# Canister Metadata

## Overview

Canisters can store custom metadata, which is available from the state tree at `/canister/<canister id>/metadata/<name>`.

You can configure this metadata in dfx.json, per canister, in the `metadata` array.

Here is a simple example:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "app_backend": {
      "main": "src/app_backend/main.mo",
      "type": "motoko"
    },
    "app_frontend": {
      "dependencies": [
        "app_backend"
      ],
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/app_frontend/src/index.html"
      },
      "source": [
        "src/app_frontend/assets",
        "dist/app_frontend/"
      ],
      "type": "assets",
      "metadata": [
        {
          "name": "alternative-domains",
          "visibility": "public",
          "path": "src/app_frontend/metadata/alternative-domains.cbor"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "version": 1
}
```
## Fields

The JSON schema also documents these fields.

### name

A string containing the name of the wasm section.

### visibility

A string containing either `private` or `public` (the default).

Anyone can read the public metadata of a canister.

Only a controller of the canister can read its private metadata.

It is not possible to define metadata with the same name with both `private` and `public` visibility, unless they are for different networks.

### networks

An array of strings containing the names of the networks that this metadata applies to.

If this field is absent, it applies to all networks.

If this field is present as an empty array, it does not apply to any networks.

If dfx.json contains more than one metadata entry with a given name, dfx will use the first entry that matches the current network and ignore any that follow.

### path

A string containing the path of a file containing the wasm section contents. Conflicts with "content".

### content

A string containing the wasm section content directly. Conflicts with "path".

## Canister Metadata Standard

Contents should be valid UTF-8 text.

### `candid:args`

Parsed with `candid:service` to get the init arguments type of the canister.

### `candid:service`

The candid interface of the canister which excludes the init arguments type.

Dfx automatically adds `candid:service` metadata, with public visibility, for Rust and Motoko canisters.

You can, however, override this behavior by defining a metadata entry with `"name": "candid:service"`.  You can change the visibility or the contents.

For Motoko canisters, if you specify a `path` for candid:service metadata (replacing the candid:service definition generated by `moc`), dfx will verify that the candid:service definition you provide is a valid subtype of the definition that `moc` generated.

### `dfx`

A json text for `dfx` usage. It consists of independent optional objects.

#### `pullable`

The `pullable` object is necessary for the canister to be pullable.

Check [pull-dependencies](pull-dependencies.md#service-provider-workflow) for more details of each field
and how to set it in `dfx.json`.

```json
{
  "pullable": {
    "wasm_url": "http://example.com/a.wasm",
    "wasm_hash": "d180f1e232bafcee7d4879d8a2260ee7bcf9a20c241468d0e9cf4aa15ef8f312",
    "dependencies": [
      "yofga-2qaaa-aaaaa-aabsq-cai"
    ],
    "init_guide": "A natural number, e.g. 10."
  }
}
```

#### `tech_stack`

The `tech_stack` object provides a standard format to show the technologies involved to build the canister.

Check [tech-stack](tech-stack.md) for more details and how to set it in `dfx.json`.

```json
{
  "tech_stack": {
    "rust": "1.76.0",
    "ic-cdk": "0.13.0",
    "wasm-tools": null
  }
}
```

## A more complex example

In this example, we change the visibility of the `candid:service` metadata on the ic and staging networks to private, but leave it public for the local network.

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "app_backend": {
      "main": "src/app_backend/main.mo",
      "type": "motoko",
      "dependencies": [
        "dep1",
        "dep2"
      ],
      "metadata": [
        {
          "name": "candid:service",
          "networks": [ "ic", "staging" ],
          "visibility": "private"
        },
        {
          "name": "candid:service",
          "networks": [ "local" ],
          "visibility": "public"
        }
      ]
    },
    "app_frontend": {
      "dependencies": [
        "app_backend"
      ],
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/app_frontend/src/index.html"
      },
      "source": [
        "src/app_frontend/assets",
        "dist/app_frontend/"
      ],
      "type": "assets"
    },
    "dep1": {
      "type": "pull",
      "id": "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai"
    },
    "dep2": {
      "type": "pull",
      "id": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
    }
  },
  "version": 1
}
```
