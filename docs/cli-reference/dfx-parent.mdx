<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Reference"]} />

The DFINITY command-line execution environment (`dfx`) is the primary tool for creating, deploying, and managing the
dapps you develop for the IC.

Use the `dfx` parent command with flags and subcommands to specify the operations you want to perform with or without
optional arguments.

## Basic usage

``` bash
dfx [subcommand] [flag]
```

## Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `dfx` parent command or with any of the `dfx` subcommands.

| Flag              | Description                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `-h`, `--help`    | Displays usage information.                     |
| `-q`, `--quiet`   | Suppresses informational messages.              |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Displays detailed information about operations. |
| `-V`, `--version` | Displays version information.                   |

## Options

You can use the following options with the `dfx` command.

| Option                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Examples

You can use the `dfx` parent command to display usage information or version information. For example, to display
information about the version of `dfx` you currently have installed, you can run the following command:

``` bash
dfx --version
```

To view usage information for a specific subcommand, specify the subcommand and the `--help` flag. For example, to see
usage information for `dfx build`, you can run the following command:

``` bash
dfx build --help
```

### Using logging options

You can use the `--verbose` and `--quiet` flags to increment or decrement the logging level. If you donâ€™t specify any
logging level, CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, and INFO messages are logged by default. Specifying one verbose flag (`-v`)
increases the log level to include DEBUG messages. Specifying two verbose flags (`-vv`)increases the logging level to
include both DEBUG and TRACE messages.

Adding a `--quiet` flag decreases the logging level. For example, to remove all messages, you can run a command similar
the following:

``` bash
dfx build -qqqq
```

Keep in mind that using TRACE level logging (`--vv`) generates a lot of log messages that can affect performance and
should only be used when required for troubleshooting or analysis.

To output log messages to a file named `newlog.txt` and display the messages on your terminal when creating a new
project, you can run a command similar to the following:

``` bash
dfx new hello_world --log tee --logfile newlog.txt
```

### Specifying a user identity

If you create user identities with the `dfx identity new` command, you can then use the `--identity` comment-line option
to change the user context when running other `dfx` commands.

In the most common use case, you use the `--identity` option to call specific canister functions to test access controls
for specific operations.

For example, you might want to test whether the `devops` user identity can call the `modify_profile` function for
the `accounts` canister by running the following command:

    dfx canister call accounts modify_profile '("Kris Smith")' --identity devops
