# dfx start

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Reference"]} />

Use the `dfx start` command to start a local development environment and web server processes. This command must be run before you can deploy canisters to the local development environment and test your dapps during development.

By default, all local `dfx` projects will use PocketIC to create this local development environment. You can run `dfx start` and `dfx stop` from any directory.  See [local server configuration](#local-server-configuration) and [project-specific local networks](#project-specific-local-networks) below for exceptions.

## Basic usage

``` bash
dfx start [option] [flag]
```

## Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `dfx start` command.

| Flag                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--background`           | Starts the local development environment and web server processes in the background and waits for a reply before returning to the shell.                                                                                              |
| `--clean`                | Starts the local development environment and web server processes in a clean state by removing checkpoints from your project cache. You can use this flag to set your project cache to a new state when troubleshooting or debugging. |
| `--enable-bitcoin`       | Enables Bitcoin integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `--enable-canister-http` | Deprecated and now enabled by default.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `--pocketic`             | Runs [PocketIC](https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic) instead of the replica. PocketIC is the default if no flag is used.                                                                                                              |

## Options

You can use the following option with the `dfx start` command.

| Option                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--host host`                     | Specifies the host interface IP address and port number to bind the frontend to. The default for the local shared network is `127.0.0.1:4943`, while the default for a project-specific network is '127.0.0.1:8000'. |
| `--bitcoin-node host:port`        | Specifies the address of a `bitcoind` node. Implies `--enable-bitcoin`.                                                                                                                                                |

| `--domain domain`                 | A domain that can be served. Can be specified more than once. These are used for canister resolution [default: localhost]                                                                                           |

## Examples

You can start the local development environment and web server processes in the current shell by running the following command:

``` bash
dfx start
```

If you start the local development environment in the current shell, you need to open a new terminal shell to run additional commands. Alternatively, you can start the local development environment in the background by running the following command:

``` bash
dfx start --background
```

If you run the local development environment in the background, however, be sure to stop the local development environment before uninstalling or reinstalling the `dfx` execution environment by running the following command:

``` bash
dfx stop
```

You can view the current process identifier (`pid`) for the local development environment process started by `dfx` by running the following command:

``` bash
more .dfx/pid
```

## Local server configuration

### The shared local network

`dfx start` manages a PocketIC server that provides a local development environment. Running `dfx deploy` and other commands will manage canisters on this local network in the same way that `dfx deploy --network ic` deploys projects to the mainnet.

If run from outside a `dfx` project directory, or if `dfx.json` does not define the `local` network, then `dfx start` looks for the `local` network definition in `$HOME/.config/dfx/networks.json`. If this file does not exist or does not contain a definition for the `local` network, then `dfx` uses the following default definition:

```
{
  "local": {
    "bind": "127.0.0.1:4943",
    "type": "ephemeral"
  }
}
```

`dfx` stores data for the shared local network in one of the following locations, depending on your operating system:
- `$HOME/.local/share/dfx/network/local` (Linux)
- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/org.dfinity.dfx/network/local` (macOS)

### Project-specific local networks

If `dfx.json` defines the `local` network, then `dfx start` will use this definition and store network data files under `<project dir>/.dfx/network/local`.

Note that for projects that define the `local` network in `dfx.json`, you can only run the `dfx start` and `dfx stop` commands from within the project directory structure. For example, if your project name is `hello_world`, your current working directory must be the `hello_world` top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories.
