Use the `dfx killall` command to forcibly kill all `dfx`-related process.

## Basic usage

``` bash
dfx killall [flag]
```

## Examples

You can kill a stuck process that is not responding to `dfx stop` with this command:

```bash
dfx killall
```

This may impact IDE plugins, including from other versions of `dfx`. For ordinary usage `dfx stop` should be preferred.
