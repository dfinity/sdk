# dfx start

Use the `dfx start` command to start a local canister execution environment and web server processes for the current project. This command enables you to deploy canisters to the local canister execution environment to test your dapps during development.

Note that you can only run this command from within the project directory structure. For example, if your project name is `hello_world`, your current working directory must be the `hello_world` top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories.

## Basic usage

``` bash
dfx start [option] [flag]
```

## Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `dfx start` command.

| Flag              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `--background`           | Starts the local canister execution environment and web server processes in the background and waits for a reply before returning to the shell.                                                                                              |
| `--clean`                | Starts the local canister execution environment and web server processes in a clean state by removing checkpoints from your project cache. You can use this flag to set your project cache to a new state when troubleshooting or debugging. |

## Examples

You can start the local canister execution environment and web server processes in the current shell by running the following command:

``` bash
dfx start
```

If you start the local canister execution environment in the current shell, you need to open a new terminal shell to run additional commands. Alternatively, you can start the local canister execution environment in the background by running the following command:

``` bash
dfx start --background
```

If you run the local canister execution environment in the background, however, be sure to stop the local canister execution environment before uninstalling or reinstalling the `dfx` execution environment by running the following command:

``` bash
dfx stop
```

You can view the current process identifier (`pid`) for the local canister execution environment process started by `dfx` by running the following command:

``` bash
more .dfx/pid
```
