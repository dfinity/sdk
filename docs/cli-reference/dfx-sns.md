## dfx sns create

Use the `dfx sns create` command to create an SNS configuration file. The configuration file specifies important, legally and financially relevant details about dapp decentralization.  The file leaves blank parameters such as token name; you will need to fill these in.

### Basic usage

``` bash
dfx sns create
```

### Examples

You can use the `dfx sns create` command to create and view a configuration file:

``` bash
dfx sns create
less sns.yml
```

## dfx sns validate

Use the `dfx sns validate` command to verify that an SNS configuration file is well formed.

### Basic usage

``` bash
dfx sns validate
```

### Examples

You can use the `dfx sns validate` command to verify that a configuration template is valid.  It is not; it needs details such as token name:

``` bash
dfx sns config create
```
Fill in the blank fields, then:
``` bash
dfx sns config validate
```

## dfx sns deploy

Use the `dfx sns deploy` command to create SNS canisters according to the local configuration file.

Note:  Deploying SNS canisters does not require a proposal, however there is a hefty fee.  Please don't create canisters on mainnet until you have tested your configuration locally and are sure that you are happy with it.

### Basic usage

``` bash
dfx sns deploy
```

### Examples

Create an SNS on the local testnet:
``` bash
dfx sns config create
```
Fill in the blank fields, then:
``` bash
dfx sns config validate
dfx sns deploy
```
You can now verify that the sns canisters have been created.  E.g.:
```
dfx canister info sns_root
dfx canister info sns_ledger
```
