# dfx ping

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Reference"]}/>

Use the `dfx ping` command to check connectivity to a network. This command enables you to verify that you can connect to the environment where you want to deploy to.

To ping your local server, please note that you can only run this command from within the project directory structure. For example, if your project name is `hello_world`, your current working directory must be the `hello_world` top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories.

To ping mainnet, you can run `dfx ping ic` from any directory.

## Basic usage

``` bash
dfx ping [provider] [flag]
```

## Arguments

You can specify the following argument for the `dfx ping` command.

| Argument | Description                                                   |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| provider | Specifies the network URL that you want to use. |

## Examples

You can use the `dfx ping` command to check whether the mainnet is currently available at a specific network address by running a command similar to the following:

``` bash
dfx ping https://icp-api.io
```

If the IC is running on the specified network provider address, the command returns output similar to the following:
