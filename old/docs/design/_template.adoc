== Overview
////
:required:

In a few sentences, describe the key objectives. Why do we need this feature?
What are we trying to accomplish?

Just a few sentences.
////

== Background
////
:required:

Include as much information as necessary here to understand the design. Include
glossary if necessary in this section. Links to examples, related projects
or other design docs. Any previous/current version of this feature.

Do not write ideas about how to solve the problem here.
////

=== Problem Statement
////
:required:

State the problem this design solves, in a concise way. A few sentences, not more.
////

=== Requirements
////
:optional:

State which requirements are necessary to consider this problem solved. This is in
relation to the solution, not the problem.
////

== Expected User/Developer Experience
////
:required: Either User and/or Developer experience should be explained.

Describe what
////

== Prior Art
////
:optional: But recommended.

Link to other products available as comparatives to this design. For example,
if another tool has a similar feature, list pros/cons/shortcomings of that tool.
////

== Detailed Design
////
:required:

Full design on how to implement the feature. Use this section to also describe
why some simpler approaches did not work. Mention other things to watch out
for during implementation.

Keep in mind that you might not be the person implementing the design.
////

=== Considered Solutions
////
:required:

What solutions were considered, with a list of pros and cons of each solutions.
////

=== Recommended Solution
////
:required:

What solution from the above are you recommending, and most importantly, WHY?
////

=== Public API
////
:optional: Required if there is any public API changes

List any new or current API changes. List traits, methods, arguments and any
types. A good way is to paste an example of the API in the language it will be
implemented, for example (with Rust):

[source,rust]
----
/// Confabulate the splines using reverse polarity. Can return an error if
/// the space is asynchronously stochastic.
pub fn confabulate(spline: &mut [&Spline], polarity: bool) -> Result<(), Error> {}
----

It's important to avoid implementations here and speak in general terms.
////

=== Prototype
////
:optional:

If a proof of concept is available, include a link to the files here (even if
it's in the same PR).
////

=== Security Considerations
////
:optional:

How will this feature impact security, and what needs to be done to keep it
secure. Considerations should include:
  - User input sanitization
  - Existing security protocols and standards
  - Permissions, Access Control and capabilities
  - Privacy, GDPR considerations, etc.
  - Anything else that can affect security and privacy.
////

=== Performance Considerations
////
:optional:

How will the feature affect speed and performance. Will there be a need to
benchmark the feature (and if so, how)? Is there any considerations to keep
in mind for avoiding and preventing future regressions?
////

== Breaking Changes
////
:optional:

Does this feature create or require breaking changes?
////

=== Deprecation
////
:optional:

Does this feature deprecates any existing APIs?
////

== Documentation
////
:required:

How will this feature be documented? Which people need to be involved?
////

== Lifecycle

=== Integration Plan
////
:optional: Required if there are interactions with other tools.

How will this feature interact with other tools? Is there any changes outside
of the SDK that are required to make this feature work? Does this feature
have integration with `dfx`?
////

=== Publishing Plan
////
:optional: Required if there are new packages.

Explain which new packages will be released and published with this feature.
Include any changes to current released packages.
////

=== Rollout / Migration
////
:optional:

How can we minimize impact to users? How do we maximize adoption?
////

=== Rollback Plan
////
:optional:

How do you plan to rollback the change if a major issue is found?
////

=== Maintenance Plan
////
:required:

How do you plan to maintain this feature for the next years? Can the
APIs be cleanly evolved? Can Breaking Changes in the future be avoided?

If this is a service, what is the update and monitoring strategy?

If this is a package, how do we plan to publish and deploy it? This includes
version numbering.
////

== Work Breakdown
////
:required:

Description of the various phases and milestones. This is supposed to be a
bullet point list of high level stories and tasks. It is not meant to be a
1:1 ratio of PRs.
