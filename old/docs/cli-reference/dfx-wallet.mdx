## Using your wallet

After you have used the `dfx identity deploy-wallet` command to create a cycles wallet canister tied to an identity, you can use `dfx wallet` commands to modify your cycles wallet settings, send cycles to other cycles wallets, and add or remove controllers and custodians. 

## dfx wallet add-controller

Use the `dfx wallet add-controller` to add a controller to the wallet. An identity assigned the role of Controller has the most privileges and can perform the following actions on the selected identity's cycles wallet:

* Add entries to the address book.

* Add and remove controllers.

* Authorize and deauthorize custodians.

A controller is also a custodian and can perform the following actions associated with that role:

* Access wallet information.

* Send cycles.

* Forward calls.

* Create canisters. 


### Basic usage


```
dfx wallet add-controller [option] <controller> [flag]
