# Environment variables

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Reference"]} />

You can configure certain properties for your SDK execution environment using environment variables.

This section lists the environment variables that are currently supported with examples of how to use them. In most cases, you can set environment variables for a session by executing an command in the terminal or by adding a line similar to the following to your `.profile` file:

```shell
export DFX_NETWORK=ic
```

## CANISTER_CANDID_PATH\_\{canister.name\}

Use environment variables with the `CANISTER_CANDID_PATH` prefix to reference the path to the Candid description file for the canisters that are listed as dependencies in the `dfx.json` file for your project.

For example, if you have a `whoami_frontend` canister that lists `whoami` under the `dependencies` key, you could use the `CANISTER_CANDID_PATH_whoami_frontend` environment variable to refer to the location of the `whoami.did` file, which for local development might be:

    $PROJECT_ROOT/.dfx/local/canisters/whoami/whoami.did

## CANISTER_ID\_\{canister.name\}

Use environment variables with the `CANISTER_ID` prefix to reference the canister identifier for each canister in the `dfx.json` file for your project. Hyphens are invalid in environment variables and are replaced by underscores.  Lowercase characters are replaced by uppercase characters.

For example, if you have a `linkedup` project that consists of the `linkedup` and `connect-d` canisters, you could use the `CANISTER_ID_LINKEDUP` and `CANISTER_ID_CONNECT_D` environment variables to refer to the canister identifiers—for example `ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai` and `rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai`—created for your project.

## DFX_CONFIG_ROOT

Use the `DFX_CONFIG_ROOT` environment variable to specify a different location for storing the `.cache` and `.config` subdirectories for `dfx`.

By default, the `.cache` and `.config` directories are located in the home directory for your development environment. For example, on macOS the default location is in the `/Users/<YOUR-USER-NAME>` directory. Use the `DFX_CONFIG_ROOT` environment variable to specify a different location for these directories.

    DFX_CONFIG_ROOT=~/ic-root

## DFX_INSTALLATION_ROOT

Use the `DFX_INSTALLATION_ROOT` environment variable to specify a different location for the `dfx` binary if you are not using the default location for your operating system.

The `.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh` script uses this environment variable to identify the root directory for your SDK installation.

## DFX_VERSION

Use the `DFX_VERSION` environment variable to identify a specific version of the SDK that you want to install.

    DFX_VERSION=0.10.0 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"

## DFX_MOC_PATH

Use the `DFX_MOC_PATH` environment variable to use a different version of the Motoko compiler than the one bundled with a given dfx version.

## DFX_WARNING

Use the `DFX_WARNING` environment variable to disable one or more warnings that dfx may display. The value is a comma-separated list of warning names, each prefixed with a "-" to disable. The following warning names are currently supported:

- `version_check`: Disables the warning message that is displayed when you use an older version of the SDK.
- `mainnet_plaintext_identity`: Disables the warning message that is displayed when you use an insecure identity on the Internet Computer mainnet.

```bash
export DFX_WARNING="-version_check"
DFX_VERSION=0.13.1 dfx deploy --network ic

export DFX_WARNING="-mainnet_plaintext_identity"
dfx deploy --network ic

# disable multiple warnings, though dfx 0.13.1 does not know about the mainnet_plaintext_identity warning
export DFX_WARNING="-version_check,-mainnet_plaintext_identity"
DFX_VERSION=0.13.1 dfx deploy --network ic
```

## DFX_DISABLE_QUERY_VERIFICATION

Set this to a non-empty value to disable verification of replica-signed queries.
