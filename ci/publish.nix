# Build a script to copy the dfx and install.sh release to the
# dfinity-download S3 bucket which is the origin of the
# download.dfinity.systems world-wide CDN.
#
# To run the dfx deployment script locally:
#   * nix run -f ./ci/ci.nix publish.dfx -c activate
# and make sure that the environment variables
# "SLACK_CHANNEL_BUILD_NOTIFICATIONS_WEBHOOK" and "DFINITY_DOWNLOAD_DOMAIN" are
# set and that the environment variable "DFINITY_DOWNLOAD_BUCKET" is set and
# that you have access to the bucket.
#
# To run the install deployment script locally:
#   * nix run -f ./ci/ci.nix publish.install-sh -c activate
#  and make sure your AWS credentials are set, that the environment variable
#  "DFINITY_DOWNLOAD_BUCKET" is set and that you have access to the bucket.
#
# This script will be executed by DFINITY's Continuous Deployment
# system. That system will also set the correct AWS credentials and the
# DFINITY_DOWNLOAD_BUCKET environment variable.
