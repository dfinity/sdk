# This function returns a Hydra jobset like for example:
#
#   {
#     ...
#     dfx.build.x86_64-linux = derivation { system = "x86_64-linux"; ... };
#     dfx.build.x86_64-darwin = derivation { system = "x86_64-darwin"; ... };
#     publish.dfx.x86_64-linux = derivation { system = "x86_64-linux"; ... };
#     ...
#   }
#
# by applying it to a jobset specification like:
#
#   {
#     ...
#     dfx.build = derivation { ... };
#     publish.dfx = lib.linuxOnly ( derivation { ... } );
#     ...
#   }
#
# So it transforms every top-level derivation in the specification to a set of
# jobs for every supported system (filtered by what the derivation supports).
#
# This function should be used in `common`, `dfinity`, `sdk` and `infra` to
# define their Hydra jobsets.
#
# TODO: This function is independent of this repo and should be moved to
# `common` eventually. See: https://dfinity.atlassian.net/browse/INF-1151
